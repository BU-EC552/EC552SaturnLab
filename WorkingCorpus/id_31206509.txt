The field of synthetic biology aims to utilize existing or novel biological parts and systems to create organisms that can help address global problems including increased demand for food, fuel, therapeutics, and high value chemicals. However, one of the major obstacles in synthetic biology is that many organisms of interest lack genetic tools such as autonomously replicating plasmids, well characterized promoters and terminators, selective markers, genome-editing tools, and protocols to uptake and install DNA . This problem can be addressed by cloning whole chromosomes or large DNA fragments from an organism of interest in a surrogate host, where genetic tools are in place and manipulations can be performed [–]. Currently, the most common host for the capture and manipulation of DNA fragments is  [–], however returning cloned or engineered fragments to destination cells is still challenging due to the lack of direct transfer methods from . , such as bacterial conjugation. In addition, .  cannot maintain large DNA fragments with G+C content >40% without additional engineering [–], and many industrially useful bacterial strains have a G+C content above this range. For example,  species have a G+C content >65% and are important for the production of antibiotics (gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, etc.) . Therefore, it is desirable to develop a host to clone, maintain, manipulate, and transfer DNA fragments, including high G+C content, to bacterial and eukaryotic destination cells. is an attractive host candidate for this application. .  is a Gram-negative α-Proteobacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume plants where it fixes nitrogen in root nodules, and therefore is highly important in agriculture. .  model strain Rm1021 has a multipartite genome including a chromosome (3.65 Mb), pSymA megaplasmid (1.35 Mb), and pSymB chromid (1.68 Mb) . Multiple derivatives of .  now exist that vary in genome size, nutrient requirements and generation time . Recently, a derivative of .  with a minimal genome lacking the pSymA and pSymB replicons was developed, resulting in a 45% reduction of the genome . Two essential genes were identified in the pSymB chromid,  and tRNA, and these genes were transferred to the main chromosome . The replication origins of pSymA and pSymB were identified and characterized , and can be used to generate designer replicating plasmids. Additionally, several genetic tools have been developed for this species including vectors based on  origins taken from various α-Proteobacteria that can be propagated in .  . Three of these vectors can be maintained within wildtype .  at one time, along with the endogenous pSymA and pSymB replicons. Utilizing these vectors, an  cloning method with Cre/lox-mediated translocation of large DNA fragments to the -based vector was established . Therefore, .  is an attractive host organism due to its high G+C content genome (62%) , available origins of replication that could be used to maintain large DNA fragments, expanding genetic toolbox, and applications in agriculture. .  is also an attractive host bacterium because it is able to move DNA to other organisms using several methods. Previous studies have demonstrated DNA transfer methods from .  through introduction of a Ti plasmid to plant species through mobilization of TDNA . In addition, .  is able to move DNA to bacteria via conjugation in tri-parental mating experiments . Installing a conjugative plasmid into . , such as pTA-Mob, will allow for faster and more efficient transfer of DNA to a recipient organism. The conjugative pTA-Mob plasmid, which contains all of the genes required for direct DNA transfer via conjugation, can mobilize any additional cargo plasmid containing an origin of transfer (). Conjugation is a particularly attractive method of DNA transfer to streamline the workflow for genetic manipulation of organisms. While transfer of DNA from .  to bacterial cells has been demonstrated, DNA transfer to eukaryotic cells, such as yeast and algae, has not been previously described. Here, we utilized the reduced genome strains of .   to create designer strains with the restriction-system removed and the conjugative pTA-Mob  plasmid installed. In addition, we used identified origins from .  pSymA and pSymB replicons to create multi-host shuttle (MHS) vectors that replicate in . , , . , and . The MHS vectors were tested for their ability to provide antibiotic resistance and propagate in . . These vectors were moved into .  strains via an optimized electroporation protocol, via a newly developed polyethylene glycol (PEG) method, or via conjugation from . . Most notably, we have developed protocols to directly transfer the MHS vectors via conjugation from .  to . , . , and . . Development of designer bacterial strains Initially, we engineered .  strains to remove the restriction-system (Δ) to allow for development of more efficient transformation methods. Disruption or deletion of the  gene has been previously reported in the Rm1021 strain of . , and deletion mutants were shown to have enhanced transformation efficiencies . In our reduced .  strains, either lacking one or both of the pSymA or pSymB replicons, the  gene was replaced by a FRT-Km/Nm-FRT cassette and the resulting ::Nm mutant allele was transferred to various background strains via transduction of Nm. The FRT-Km/Nm-FRT cassette was then removed by introducing an unstable plasmid (pTH2505) carrying the Flp recombinase, followed by curing of this plasmid. The  deletion strains were verified to have the  gene successfully deleted using diagnostic PCR with primers located upstream and downstream of the  gene locus (Figure A in ). .  RmP4098 ∆pSymA , retaining the Km/Nm cassette and the pSymB chromid, was chosen as our host strain as it had the fastest doubling time when compared to the other reduced-genome strains . . pSymA , was transformed with the pTA-Mob plasmid  and used as the conjugative donor strain for all subsequent experiments (). In addition, reduced .  strains RmP3952 ∆pSymB Δ and RmP3909 ΔpSymAB Δ were developed using the same method described above. Additionally, a designer .  strain was developed to simplify the current method of conjugation from . . We used lambda red recombination to create an auxotrophic strain of .  Epi300, named ECGE101, by deleting the  gene. This gene is required for synthesis of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) , therefore ECGE101 requires DAP supplementation in the growth media and provides a useful, antibiotic-free method for counter-selecting .  after conjugation to .  or any other organism. 10.1371/journal.pone.0206781.g001 Development of designer .  strains and multi-functional vectors. (a) Schematic of the designer .  ΔpSymA Δ strains including the genome reduction and deletion of the restriction-system. Several versions of the designer strains were developed including strains with the pTA-Mob conjugative plasmid, and/or compatible genome engineering vectors (pAGE or pBGE) installed. (b) Vector map of pAGE/pBGE MHS vector with both standard and interchangeable components. Standard components include the BAC and YAC backbone (BAC/YAC), an origin of transfer (), and the selectable marker for .  nourseothricin N-acetyl transferase (Ntc). Interchangeable components include selectable markers for . : tetracycline (Tet), kanamycin/neomycin (Neo), and spectinomycin (Spec); and origins of replication for . : the pSymA origin (), and pSymB origin (). Three vectors (pAGE1.0, pAGE2.0, and pAGE3.0) were constructed utilizing the  origin with Spec, Tet or Neo selection, respectively. Three vectors (pBGE1.0, pBGE2.0, and pBGE3.0) were constructed utilizing the  origin with Spec, Tet or Neo selection, respectively. (c) Following conjugation of three pAGE plasmids from .  ECGE101 conjugative strain to .  RmP4122 pSymA  Nm, an antibiotic selection test for each plasmid was performed. The pAGE1.0, pAGE2.0, and pAGE3.0 vectors in .  contain antibiotic resistance markers for Spec, Tet, and Neo, respectively. .  without a plasmid (control) was plated alongside .  harbouring pAGE1.0, pAGE2.0, or pAGE3.0 on LBmc agar, and LBmc agar supplemented with either spectinomycin (200 μg mL), tetracycline (10 μg mL), or neomycin (100 μg mL). Design, assembly and characterization of multi-host shuttle vectors With the reduced, restriction-system minus strains of .  created, and the origins of replications of the large megaplasmid and chromid ( and ) identified, MHS vectors were developed as cargo plasmids for conjugation from .  to various recipients. Six MHS vectors were designed and constructed to allow for stable replication and selection in our .  conjugative donor, as well as several conjugative recipient organisms including . , . , and . . These organisms were chosen as conjugative recipients as they are well-characterized model strains for bacterial, yeast and algal systems. These vectors were constructed with a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) backbone allowing for replication in .  and .  . The YAC also allows replication in .  . The MHS vectors contain an origin of replication captured from the native megaplasmid of . , pSymA (, denoted pAGE vectors), or the pSymB chromid (, denoted pBGE vectors). Selectable markers include spectinomycin (Sp), tetracycline (Tc), or kanamycin/neomycin (Km/Nm) resistance for .  (but also conferring some resistance in . ), nourseothricin N-acetyl transferase (Ntc) for .  , HIS3 for . , and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance for . . Finally, all MHS vectors contain an origin of transfer () that is acted on by proteins encoded on the conjugative plasmid pTA-Mob, and is necessary for mobilization of the MHS vectors from .  to recipient organisms (). Three versions of the pAGE vector differing only in the .  selective marker, pAGE1.0 (Sp), pAGE2.0 (Tc), and pAGE3.0 (Km/Nm), were constructed with the pSymA origin (). An additional three pBGE vectors differing only in the .  selective marker, pBGE1.0 (Sp), pBGE2.0 (Tc), and pBGE3.0 (Km/Nm), were constructed with the pSymB origin (). Once assembled , the vectors were transformed into .  Epi300 (Epicentre) cells, isolated and confirmed to be correctly assembled by a diagnostic restriction digest (Figure B in ). The three pAGE vectors were conjugated to .  RmP4122 pSymA  Nm from .  ECGE101 conjugative strains, and .  transconjugants were plated on their respective antibiotic selections. We demonstrated that pAGE1.0, pAGE2.0, and pAGE3.0 in .  provide resistance to Sp, Tc, and Nm, respectively (). Following transformation of pAGE2.0 into .  RmP4122 pSymA  Nm, vector stability was tested by iterative subculturing every 10 generations to a total of about 50 generations. We observed, on average, that approximately 25% of vectors were lost after 50 generations, as determined by the number of colonies unable to grow on selective media (LBmc 38 μM FeCl 2 μM CoCl Tc 5 μg/mL) after restreaking from non-selective media (LBmc 38 μM FeCl 2 μM CoCl) (Figure C in  and Table A in ). Optimization of DNA transfer to .  via electroporation, a new polyethylene glycol transformation method and conjugation In order to develop .  as a host, a highly efficient transformation method is required for the uptake of DNA. Currently, the most common transformation method used in .  is electroporation. Optimization of this method through transformation of .  RmP4122 pSymA  Nm with three pAGE vectors (~18 kb) produced efficiencies averaging 1.4 x 10 CFU μg of DNA (Figure D in  and Table B in ). Additionally, since a PEG transformation method was successfully applied to move large DNA fragments (>1 Mb) in the transplantation protocol required to create the first synthetic cell , we developed a PEG-mediated transformation method in .  and were able to obtain efficiencies on average of 2.1 x 10 CFU μg of DNA (Figures E and F in  and Table B in ). In addition, conjugation has been previously established as a method of DNA transfer to .  , therefore we have developed an improved conjugation protocol from our conjugative .  ECGE101 strain carrying the pTA-Mob and pAGE1.0 vectors. Using this method we obtained a conjugation efficiency averaging 4 transconjugants per every 10 recipient cells (Table B in ). Direct DNA transfer (via conjugation) from .  to . , .  and . We utilized the designer .  RmP4098 ΔpSymA Δ host strain carrying the pTA-Mob conjugative plasmid and pAGE1.0 compatible genome engineering vector to develop direct DNA transfer of pAGE1.0 (via conjugation) from .  to . , . , and .  ( and ). The ~18 kb pAGE1.0 vector contains the pSymA origin () and the spectinomycin selectable marker for . . Conjugation efficiencies were calculated as the number of transconjugants per recipient cell from the .  conjugative donor to . , . , and .  as 2.22 x 10, 7.99 x 10 and 9.40 x 10, respectively ( and Table C in ). Additionally, we have developed a high throughput conjugation protocol in a 96-well plate from .  to .  that could be used for large-scale experiments and in an automated facility (). Development of these direct DNA transfer protocols is a critical step in the development of .  as a robust host for genome engineering and will facilitate its use in synthetic biology applications. Next, we evaluated the conjugated pAGE1.0 vectors for DNA rearrangements and potential mutations that could have been introduced during conjugation from .  to . , .  and . . In the first case, 20 .  transconjugant vectors were induced with 0.1% arabinose to obtain high copy number and were directly isolated from . . The pAGE1.0 vector replicates as a low-copy plasmid in .  and .  and it cannot be induced with arabinose to obtain high copy number within these species. Therefore, 60 vectors from .  and .  transconjugants were isolated and transformed into . , then induced and once again isolated to obtain high quality DNA. DNA isolated from 59 out of 60 .  transconjugants and 58 out of 60 .  transconjugants resulted in .  colonies following transformation (Table D in ). Then, 20 .  transformants (each transformed with DNA from independent .  colonies) and 30 .  transformants (each transformed with DNA from independent .  colonies) were selected, induced with 0.1% arabinose, and the vector DNA was isolated. Diagnostic restriction digests were performed on these vectors using EcoRV-HF, and the number of vectors with the expected banding pattern was 18/20 originating from . , 19/20 originating from .  and 16/30 originating from .  (Figures G-I in  and Table D in ). Therefore, we can observe that correct pAGE1.0 vectors can be rescued when conjugated from .  90% of time in . , 93% of the time in . , and 52% of the time in . . Finally, sequencing of pAGE1.0 plasmids recovered from . , .  and .  transconjugants with a correct banding pattern following digestion with EcoRV-HF, revealed that no significant mutations were introduced. In summary, pAGE and pBGE MHS vectors were developed and shown to be stably propagated in . , . , . , and . . These multi-host and multi-functional vectors have promising applications for the cloning of large, high G+C content DNA fragments and their direct transfer to prokaryotic and eukaryotic target organisms. Conjugation of these vectors from .  to . , . , and . , as well as showing .  as a conjugative recipient, illustrates that .  can be a suitable host organism for inter-kingdom transfer of DNA. Due to the range of recipient organisms demonstrated, conjugation could be expanded to other target organisms in the future. These hosts will be invaluable for the cloning and installation of genes, synthetic chromosomes, or large biosynthetic pathways, the study of organisms lacking genetic tools, and specifically for applications in industrially and agriculturally important strains such as plants, marine organisms, and soil microbiomes. 10.1371/journal.pone.0206781.g002 Optimized conjugation protocols from .  to various recipient organisms.

Microbial strains and growth conditions strains were grown at 30°C in LBmc medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, 0.301 g MgSO, and 0.277 g anhydrous CaCl were dissolved in sddHO to a final volume of 1 L, and then autoclaved. Solid plates contained 1.5% agar.) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (streptomycin (100 μg mL), spectinomycin (200 μg mL), gentamicin (40 μg mL), tetracycline (5 μg mL), neomycin (100 μg mL)), and 38 μM FeCl and/or 2 μM CoCl, when appropriate.  VL6−48 (ATCC MYA-3666: MATα his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ1 ura3−52 lys2 ade2−1 met14 cir) was grown at 30°C in rich medium (2X YPD) supplemented with 80 mg L adenine hemisulfate, or yeast synthetic complete medium lacking histidine supplemented with 60 mg L adenine sulfate (Teknova, Inc.) .  (Epi300, Epicenter) was grown at 37°C in Luria Broth (LB) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol (15 μg mL)).  (ECGE101) was grown at 37°C in Luria Broth (LB) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol (15 μg mL), gentamicin (40 μg mL)), and diaminopimelic acid (60 μg mL).  (Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa CCAP 1055/1) was grown in L1 medium without silica at 18°C under cool white fluorescent lights (75 μE m s) and a photoperiod of 16 h light:8 h dark . L1 media was prepared as previously described . Designer .  strains used in this study were created by taking the strain RmP3500, which lacks pSymA and pSymB where the  genomic region has been introduced into the chromosome  and re-introducing either pSymA or pSymB or both. Specifically, RmP4098, was made by re-introducing pSymB from RmP3491 into the strain RmP3910, which is derived from RmP3500, to create the strain RmP3950. From there, a Nm resistance cassette from strain RmP3975 was transduced into strain RmP3950. Double homologous recombination of the Nm cassette from RmP3975 into the genome of RmP3950 was selected on Nm Sm plates. The resulting strain, RmP4098, is ΔpSymA pSymB+ ::Nm, Nm Sm. RmP3975 is a strain where the  restriction gene has been replaced by a Nm resistance cassette. This strain was created by first PCR amplifying a downstream region and upstream region of the  gene and cloning these PCR products into the  site of pUCP30T using SLiC , then transforming into chemically competent DH5α. This construct was then verified via sequencing using M13 universal primers. The pUCP30T plasmid (Gm) with the  upstream/downstream regions was then transformed into an .  strain harboring pKD46 (Amp) which includes genes for lambda red recombinase, the resulting strain was named M2453. A Km/Nm cassette for  deletion was then PCR amplified using high-fidelity DNA polymerase and purified. The cassette consisted of the antibiotic resistance gene flanked by regions of homology to the  regions cloned into pUCP30T. The cassette was then electroporated into competent M2453 cells (grown in 1mM Arabinose to induce lambda red recombinase genes) and selected using Km (25 μg mL). Cells were then patched on Km (25 μg mL), Gm (10 μg mL) and Amp (100 μg mL). A Km, Gm, and Amp strain was then streak purified and named M2459. The resulting vector was then conjugated into RmP110 as recipient and M2459 as donor. Selection was done in Sm (200 μg mL) Nm (200 μg mL) plates. Resulting transconjugants were then patched on Gm (10 μg mL), (Nm 200 μg mL) and Sm (200 μg mL) plates and a Gm sensitive colony was streak purified (indicating double recombination of cassette with  locus). The strain was then verified using diagnostic primers that spanned the  upstream/downstream region with the Km/Nm cassette. The Nm resistance cassette was then able to be transduced into the .  strains containing various combinations of pSymA and pSymB and selecting for Nm resistance. The Nm resistance cassette was then excised by introducing Flp recombinase to flip out the cassette using flanking FRT sites. The resulting strains are are RmP4258 (pSymA- pSymB- Δ), RmP4260 (pSymA+ pSymB- Δ), RmP4124 (pSymA- pSymB+ Δ), and RmP4125 (pSymA+ pSymB+ Δ). Development of .  ECGE101 Δ strain The  gene replacement with lambda pir and an erythromycin cassette from strain βDH10B was replicated in Epi300, resulting in a strain containing  and requirement of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) supplementation for growth. This is useful because it allows for replication of plasmids with RK2 oriV and makes it a convenient donor in biparental conjugation because the DAP requirement eliminates the need for antibiotic counter-selection. A lambda red recombinase plasmid (pKD46) was electroporated into Epi300, because Epi300 is recA-. The  region from βDH10B was amplified using the flanking primers DAP1 and DAP2. The fragment was electroporated into .  Epi300 containing pKD46 and transformants were selected on LB with DAP (60 μg mL) and erythromycin (200 μg mL), and inability to grow in the absence of DAP was confirmed. Such transformants were cured of pKD46 by growing at 37°C and confirming ampicillin (100 μg mL) sensitivity. Vector construction (pAGE/pBGE multi-host shuttle vectors) Briefly, pAGE and pBGE vectors were constructed based on the pCC1BAC vector to which elements for replication in yeast were added. This backbone was amplified from plasmid p0521s (created at Venter institute and available on Addgene). This will allow replication and selection in yeast and . . Additionally, it is low copy vector that can be induced to high copy with arabinose. Other components amplified for vector assembly include the antibiotic resistance cassettes for selection in . ,  or  for replication in . , origin of transfer () for conjugation, and selective marker for algae (Ntc). The six fragments were PCR amplified and assembled in yeast using a yeast spheroplast transformation method. Next, DNA was isolated from yeast and moved to .  strain PG5alpha and genotyped using a multiplex PCR screen. Correct vectors were moved from PG5alpha to Epi300 and Epi300 pTA-Mob. Diagnostic digests were performed to confirm correct assembly of vectors. Vector stability assay of pAGE2.0 To characterize the ability of the Δ strains to maintain these large pAGE vectors, stability assays were performed to determine how long pAGE2.0 can be maintained in RmP4122 pSymANm. This was performed in triplicate. Single colonies harboring pAGE2.0 were inoculated into LBmc FeCl + CoCl with Tc (5μg mL) at 30°C. The next day, 100uL of culture diluted to 10 was plated on LBmc FeCl + CoCl and grown 3 days at 30°C. Cultures were subcultured 1000X in LBmc FeCl + CoCl without antibiotics and grown overnight. Approximately 10 doublings occurred per day. The next day, cultures were diluted to 10 and again 100μL was plated on LBmc FeCl + CoCl. Cultures were subcultured again as before. When visible, 100 colonies were patched onto LBmc FeCl + CoCl with Tc (5μg mL) and without Tc as a control to ensure colony viability. These plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 days. The number of patched colonies that were able to grow on selective media was then recorded. The experiment was performed for 5 days to assess stability of pAGE2.0.

Cells were then resuspended in 100 mL of ice-cold 100 mM CaCl by gentle pipetting and incubated on ice for an additional 30 minutes. Following incubation, cells were pelleted again at 4000 x g and 4°C for 10 minutes and resuspended in 1.25 mL of ice-cold 100 mM CaCl + 15% glycerol. The final resuspension volume was split into 25 μL aliquots, flash frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C for later use. PEG-mediated transformation of .
