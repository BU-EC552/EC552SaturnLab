Since their development, HACs
or human artificial chromosomes have been considered to be a promising
system for gene delivery and expression, with the potential to overcome
many problems caused by the use of virus-based gene transfer systems.
Indeed, HACs are stably maintained as single copy episomes. Their
use avoids the limited cloning capacity, the lack of copy number control
and potential insertional mutagenesis due to integration into host
chromosomes that has hampered the use of viral vectors. There are two types of HACs in general use: “top down”
HACs constructed by truncation of the natural chromosomes and “bottom
up” HACs generated from BACs carrying 30–200 kb DNA
from natural higher-order centromeric DNA repeats. Such BACs are substrates
for HAC formation in a process that is accompanied by 20–30-fold
multimerization of the input BAC DNA in human cells. Over the past
20 years, many groups have reported the successful generation of HACs
of both types (and references therein), and importantly all HACs constructed so
far have constitutive kinetochores. In the past
few years, the amount of research based on the HAC-vectors has significantly
increased due to the engineering of HACs with a single loxP gene integration
site (and references
therein). Such research has included studies on the potential of HACs
for gene function analysis, cell reprogramming and animal transgenesis. Our group constructed the alphoid-HAC from a synthetic alpha-satellite (alphoid) DNA
array with precisely defined DNA sequence starting from a 343 bp dimer
amplified by the RCA-TAR method up to
50 kb in size. This HAC includes approximately 6000 copies of the
42 bp tetracycline operator (tetO) sequence incorporated into each
alphoid dimer. Because the tetO sequence
is bound with high affinity and specificity by the Tet repressor (TetR),
the 1.1 Mb-size alphoid array in this HAC can be targeted efficiently
with TetR fusion proteins that allow the specific manipulation of
chromatin within the functional kinetochore. This provides a highly
versatile model system for the study of centrochromatin and its impact
on kinetochore structure and function in human cells. In addition, this feature of alphoid-HAC gives the
unique possibility to eliminate the HAC from cells, allowing workers
to compare the phenotypes of human cells with and without a functional
copy of a target gene inserted into the HAC. Such rigorous control is important for proper interpretation of
gene complementation analysis and studies of new gene function Recently the alphoid-HAC was applied
to investigate the problem of chromosome instability (CIN), involving
the unequal distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis
which is observed in the majority of solid tumors. While CIN acts
as a driver of cancer genome evolution and tumor progression, recent
findings point to the existence of a threshold level beyond which
CIN becomes a barrier to tumor growth and, therefore, can be exploited
therapeutically. Newly developed alphoid-HAC-based assays allow for a quick and efficient screening of hundreds
of drugs to identify those affecting chromosome mis-segregation and
also to rank compounds with the same or similar mechanism of action
based on their effect on the rate of chromosome loss. The fact that the HAC is nonessential in the absence of Blasticidin
selection greatly simplifies the interpretation of these assays. Similarly,
the alphoid-HAC-based approach was used to identify
new human CIN genes, mutations in which
are thought to be an early event in tumor development predisposing
cells to the accumulation of genetic changes leading to progression
to a cancerous state. A few years ago several laboratories suggested using artificial
chromosomes (AC) to assemble entire genomic loci using a multi-integrase
system. Such an AC-based approach opens new horizons for synthetic biology,
especially in higher eukaryotes. In this study, we designed an iterative
integration system (IIS) in such a way that potentially renders it
capable of accepting an unlimited number of DNA fragments. In general,
IIS is a method to construct large segments of transgenic DNA in a
vertebrate host genome. Our IIS method is based on three recombinase
enzymes, , Cre, ΦC31 and ΦBT1. Cre
is a bidirectional enzyme that catalyzes the recombination between
two substrate loxP sites and generates two product loxP sites. In
contrast, in the absence of an additional protein Xis, recombinases
ΦC31 and ΦBT1 are unidirectional enzymes that recombine
an attachment bacteria (attB) site and an attachment phage (attP)
site to produce attR and attL sites that are not substrates for further
reaction. A novel IIS system was combined with alphoid-HAC. The IIS-alphoid-HAC system can be used to assemble
and deliver large DNA fragments that include groups of genes for functional
studies. In future, a new HAC-based multi-integrase system carrying
multiple genes may be a unique tool for treatment of multigene genetic
disorders and for transgenesis experiments with the purpose to understand
complex diseases. In addition, the IIS-alphoid-HAC
system provides a potentially valuable genetic tool to engineer synthetic
chromosomes with a predetermined set of genes in order to investigate
complex biomedical pathways and gene(s) regulation. Construction of Plasmids for the IIS-alphoid-HAC
System http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf Five basic plasmids were constructed for the IIS-alphoid-HAC system: the platform cassette A037 on which DNA fragments/genes
can be assembled, two carrier vectors used to deliver the transgenic
DNA fragments containing promoterless compound markers called either
PCF (Pac-mCherry-FcYFur) (Type I A167 plasmid) or GHT (eGFP-hph-TK)
(Type II A169 plasmid) and two recombinase expression plasmids that
express either Cre and ΦBT1 (A135-JH) or Cre and ΦC31
(A139) () (for
construction details, see  and ). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf The platform cassette A037 consists of the SFM promoter (SV40 enhancer
plus Feritin promoter), a split mouse elongation factor 1 (mEF1) intron
containing a loxP site within, the GHT marker and the attB site of
ΦC31 (a). The platform cassette was targeted into the unique human Ch13
genomic segment present within alphoid-HAC using homologous recombination in a highly recombinogenic
chicken B-lymphoma DT40 cells (a). Before targeting, the platform cassette was XhoI-linearized
to release 5′ M2A and 3′ M2B hook sequences of 3.5 kb
and 3.9 kb in size, respectively, which have homology to the Chr13
genomic segment (see  for details).
Four pairs of diagnostic primers were used to verify correct insertion
of the platform cassette into the Ch13 segment. The expected size
products of 4.4 kb and 3.9 kb with B128/B124 and B129/B126 pairs of
primers, correspondingly, and 4.6 kb and 4.4 kb with the B034/B126
and B034/B127 pairs of primes, correspondingly, () confirms correct recombination between the M2A and
M2B hook sequences and homologous sequences of the Ch13 segment (b). After insertion
of the platform cassette into the HAC, the cells became green (GFP+),
resistant to Hygromycin and sensitive to Ganciclovir. Next, the alphoid-HAC carrying the platform cassette was moved from chicken
DT40 cells to hamster CHO cells by Microcell-Mediated Chromosome Transfer
(MMCT) (a).
A FISH image of the alphoid-HAC in CHO cells (Clone
#CHO BH3:37) is shown in c. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf The Type I and Type II carrier vectors, A167 and A169, correspondingly,
were constructed to deliver a transgenic DNA segment of interest into
the platform cassette inserted into the HAC (b, 1c). These carrier vectors are YAC-BAC
shuttle vectors and, therefore, can propagate in a single molecule
state within  as a bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) with chloramphenicol selection and in S. cerevisiae
as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) with the yeast HIS3 gene as
a selectable marker. Insertion of a transgenic DNA segment into the
carrier vector can be done  DNA ligation or yeast-based
transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning. The Type I carrier vector A167 contains in 5′–3′
order a loxP site, a promoterless PCF marker, an attB′′
ΦBT1 site, a cloning site for DNA insertion, an attP ΦC31
site, a GHT marker under a CAGG promoter flanked by tDNA insulators and a YAC-BAC backbone (b). The Type II carrier vector A169 contains a loxP
site, a promoterless GHT marker, an attB ΦC31 site, a cloning
site for DNA insertion, an attP′′ ΦBT1 site, a
PCF marker under a CAGG promoter flanked by tDNA insulators and a
YAC-BAC backbone (c). For the purpose of TAR cloning short mammalian genomic DNA segments that do not have yeast ARS-like
sequences for a proper propagation in yeast cells, a variant of each
carrier vector was made containing yeast origin of replication (ARS), , Type I-ARS (A168) and Type II-ARS (A170) (b, c and ). Two expression plasmids were constructed for the IIS-alphoid-HAC system. In these plasmids, a P2A self-cleaving peptide
is used to translationally link the expression of two recombinases
so that the two recombinases are expressed in equal ratio. The plasmid
A135-JH expresses Cre recombinase and ΦBT1 integrase (d) while the plasmid
A139 expresses Cre recombinase and ΦC31 integrase (e). These plasmids
also contain a Zeocin marker that is transcriptionally linked to the
recombinase expression  an internal ribosomal
entry site (IRES), allowing selection of these plasmids if desired. Scheme of plasmids used in the IIS-alphoid-HAC system.

in hamster CHO cells. (a) The XhoI-linearized platform cassette A037

transferred from chicken DT40 cells to hamster CHO cells. (b) Diagnostic
PCRs to verify correct targeting of the platform cassette A037 into
the Ch13 region present within the HAC. Two pairs of diagnostic primes,

and 3.9 kb in size, respectively, confirming correct recombination
between the M2A hook sequence of A037 and a homologous sequence of
the Ch13 segment. Two pairs of diagnostic primes, B034/B126 and B034/B127,
amplified the expected products of 4.6 kb and 4.4 kb in size, respectively.
This confirmed the correct recombination between the M2B hook sequence

with the BAC specific probe (in red). Description of the IIS-alphoid-HAC System The IIS-alphoid-HAC system works as follows. It starts
with CHO cells containing alphoid-HAC bearing the platform
cassette A037 (a). As the GHT marker is expressed, the cells are green (GFP), Hygromycin
resistant (hph) and are killed upon exposure to Ganciclovir (TK).
Next, these cells are cotransformed with two plasmids, , the A139 plasmid that expresses Cre recombinase and ΦC31
integrase and the Type I carrier vector A167 that contains a transgenic
DNA segment of interest (DNA1). Expression of Cre and ΦC31 promotes
two recombination events (loxP–loxP and ΦC31attB-attP)
between the Type I vector and the platform cassette (b). The order of recombination
is unimportant as the final product is identical. The SFM promoter
within the platform cassette now drives the promoterless PCF marker
and contains the adjacent attB′′ ΦBT1 site from
the Type I vector, as the original GHT marker is replaced with the
PCF marker. This is accompanied by integration of the DNA segment
of interest (DNA1) into the platform cassette within the HAC and deletion
of all other components of the Type I vector. As a result, the cells
that successfully complete both recombination reactions lose green
fluorescence and sensitivity to Ganciclovir and gains red fluorescence,
resistance to Puromycin and sensitivity to 5-Fluorocytosine. An error detection mechanism was built into the IIS-alphoid-HAC system because the recombinase-mediated reactions
can fail to go to completion. Furthermore, growth, maintenance, screening
and storage of candidate vertebrate colonies are far slower, more
labor intensive and space limited than either in yeast or bacteria.
Thus, it was desirable to remove as many faulty colonies as possible
by drug selection and keep only the best candidates for subsequent
detailed characterization. If either of the two recombination reactions fails, this failure
event can be selected against and screened out by the error proofing
design of the IIS-alphoid-HAC system (). As illustrated, the backbone
of each carrier vector has its own constitutively active compound
marker. Hence, if recombination by Cre fails but ΦC31 occurs
(a), the A167
Type I carrier vector will integrate into the platform cassette but
the PCF marker it carries will remain promoterless. Cells carrying
this error are removed by Puromycin selection and counter-selection
with Ganciclovir. Alternatively, if recombination by ΦC31 fails
but Cre occurs (b), the Type I vector A167 will integrate into the construction platform
and the SFM promoter will capture the PCF marker, leaving the original
GHT marker promoterless. However, the backbone of the Type I vector
is retained, and a fully expressed GHT marker under the CAGG promoter
remains. Hence, cells generated by such a failure event are Puromycin
resistant and have both red and green fluorescence. These types of
cells can be removed by counter selection using Ganciclovir against
the thymidine kinase component of the GHT marker. In order to avoid
the loss of TK gene activity by silencing, the GHT marker is protected
by flanking murine tDNA insulators. Once the first round of recombination is completed (DNA1), the
second round of DNA integration (DNA2) can be started. The platform
cassette in the HAC now contains a loxP site, an expressed PCF marker
and an attB′′ ΦBT1 site (c). Expression from the PCF marker gives
the cells red fluorescence, resistance to Puromycin and sensitivity
to 5-Fluorocytosine. Next, the cells are cotransformed with plasmid
A135-JH expressing Cre recombinase and ΦBT1 integrase and the
Type II carrier vector A169 containing a second transgenic DNA segment
of interest (DNA2). Cre and ΦBT1 expression causes two recombination
events (loxP–loxP and ΦBT1 attB′′–attP′′)
between the Type II vector and the platform cassette (d). This leads to the replacement
of the PCF marker by the GHT marker and an attB′′ ΦBT1
site, followed by the insertion of the second DNA segment of interest
(DNA2) from the Type1 carrier vector. As a result, the platform cassette
in the HAC will contain a loxP site, an expressed GHT marker and an
attB′′ ΦBT1 site (e). A small insertion (<60 bp) scar comprising
the recombination product of attB/attP, the attR site is left between
the first (DNA1) and the second (DNA2) DNA segments of interest. Selection
with Hygromycin and counter selection with 5-Fluorocytosine ensures
that only cells that have correctly undergone the second round of
assembly will survive (c, d). Untransformed parental cells
and cells with incomplete recombination are killed by this double
selection. After two rounds of recombination, the construction platform is
once again where it started, with the exception that two DNA segments
(DNA1 and DNA2) of interest have now been integrated into the HAC
(e). The GHT
marker is expressed and the cells have once again green fluorescence,
Hygromycin resistance and sensitivity to Ganciclovir. Further rounds
of DNA fragment insertions can be repeated indefinitely as required. Scheme of DNA segment integration by the iterative integration

platform cassette after the 1st round of integration. The PCF marker

(d) Recombination between a Type II carrier vector and a platform
cassette by Cre recombinase and ΦBT1 integrase. The PCF marker

of the platform cassette after the second round of recombination.
The cells express the GHT marker, , a green florescence

and ΦC31 integrases and Cre recombinase were active and could
mediate proper integration into alphoid-HAC carrying
the platform plasmid. For this purpose, control experiments were performed
using empty vectors. The recombinant assay plasmids were transfected
into hamster CHO cells containing the HAC in the combinations A167
plus A139 or A169 plus A135-JH. Each step of insertion was confirmed
by PCR. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf At the beginning of the experiments, hamster CHO cells
carrying the alphoid-HAC bearing the platform cassette
were green (GFP+) (Clone #CHO BH3:37). PCR of genomic DNA isolated
from the initial CHO cells carrying the HAC gave the expected 778
bp product with the forward primer for the thymidine kinase (TK) gene
(B075) and reverse primer for the M2B hook sequence (B681) and no
product with the forward primer for the cytidine deaminase gene (FcyFur)
(B485) and the reverse primer for the hook M2B sequence (B681) (; Lane 1) (). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf For the first round of insertion, CHO cells carrying the alphoid-HAC bearing the platform cassette were cotransfected by
Type I carrier plasmid A167 and plasmid A139 expressing ΦC31
integrase and Cre recombinase. The cells were cultured in Puromycin/Blasticidin
S media. After 10 days of selection, five colonies possessing red
but not green fluorescence were picked up and cultured in individual
wells in Puromycin/Ganciclovir/Blasticidin S media. In three colonies,
insertion of the 2.7 kb Ampicillin resistant gene plus pBR322 DNA
fragment from the plasmid A167 into the platform cassette was confirmed
by PCR with a pair of corresponding primers: forward B485 and reverse
B681 (). Cells bearing this insertion
gave the expected 4.1 kb product with B485/B681 primers but no product
with B075/B681 primers (; Lanes 2). Clone #E10 was chosen for further experiments. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf For the second round of insertion, the cells were cotransfected
by Type II carrier plasmid A169 and A135-JH plasmid expressing ΦBT1
integrase and Cre recombinase. The cells were cultured in Hygromycin/Blasticidin
S media. After 10 days of selection, ten colonies expressing green
but not red fluorescence were picked up and expanded in media containing
Hygromycin/5-Fluorocytidine/Blasticidin S. For nine colonies, PCR
of genomic DNA isolated from these cells gave the expected 6.2 kb
PCR product with B075/B681 primers but no product with B485/B681 primers.
This confirmed the correct insertion of the 2.7 kb fragment carried
by plasmid A169 (; Lanes

and selected for as in the first round. A total number of ten clones
were selected. PCR of genomic DNA isolated from two clones, Clone
#E10–7–3 and Clone #E10–7–1, with B485/B681
primers gave the expected 9.6 kb product while there was no product
with B075/B681 primers. This confirmed correct insertion of the 2.7
kb fragment carried by the A167 plasmid. (; Lanes 4 and 5). These results showed that the recombinases are functional and that
site-specific insertions into IIS-alphoid-HAC could
be achieved. VHL Gene Reconstruction Using IIS-alphoid-HAC
System As a proof of principle, we applied the IIS-alphoid-HAC system to reconstruct the VHL gene. Briefly, the human
VHL gene is ∼17 kb in size and contains three exons. It is
located on chromosome 3 (positions 10137959–10154492; GHCH38/hg38).
Mutations in the gene are associated with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
syndrome that is a dominantly inherited hereditary cancer syndrome
predisposing to a variety of malignant and benign tumors of the eye,
brain, spinal cord, kidney, pancreas and adrenal glands. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf For
the experiments, we used the full-length VHL gene TAR-isolated previously
from the total human genomic DNA as a ∼25 kb YAC/BAC molecule. Three fragments containing exon 1, exon 2 or
exon 3 of the VHL gene were PCR-amplified from the TAR/YAC/BAC clone
using specific primers (). The
first AscI-NotI fragment of 5990 bp in size (positions Chr3:10137959–10143949;
GRCH38/hg38) containing exon 1 along with the VHL promoter and the
third AscI-FseI fragment of 6323 bp in size (positions Chr3:10148169–10154492)
containing exon 3 were ligated with the Type I carrier vector A168
(Pac-mCherry-FcyFur) that had been digested by AscI/NotI or AscI/FseI,
correspondingly. The second AscI-NotI fragment of 4221 bp in size
(positions Chr3:10143949–10148169; GRCH38/hg38) containing
exon 2 was ligated with the Type II carrier vector A170 (GFP-hph-TK)
that was digested by AscI/NotI (a). Three rounds of insertion were performed to assemble

expressing ΦC31 integrase and Cre recombinase were cotransfected
into hamster CHO cells propagating the alphoid-HAC
bearing the platform cassette A037. Cells with this HAC are originally
green (GFP+). After the first round, the cells switched to red (mCherry+),
Puromycin and 5-Fluorocytidine resistant and carried a modified alphoid-HAC bearing the inserted exon 3 (b). A total of 14 clones were obtained after
positive selection, with 4 remaining after negative selection: Clone
#1, Clone #11, Clone #12 and Clone #14. Clone #14 was chosen for the
second round of insertion. The A170 vector containing exon 2 and the A135-JH
vector expressing ΦBT1 integrase and Cre recombinase were cotransfected
into Clone #14e CHO cells carrying the alphoid-HAC
bearing the inserted exon 3. After the second round, the cells switched
back to green (GFP+), Hygromycin and 5-Fluorocytidine resistant and
carried the alphoid-HAC with inserted exon 3 and exon
2 (b). After
positive selection, 20 clones were obtained, of which 2 were left
after negative selection: Clone #14–4 and Clone #14–12.
Clone #14–12 was chosen for the third round of insertion. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf The A168 vector containing exon 1 and the A139
vector expressing ΦC31 integrase and Cre recombinase were cotransfected
into CHO cells carrying the alphoid-HAC bearing exons
2 and 3. After the third round, the cells switched to red again (mCherry+),
Puromycin, Gancyclovir and 5-Fluorocytidine resistant. These cells
carry an alphoid-HAC with all three exons inserted
(b). After
positive selection, 3 clones were obtained, with 2 remaining after
negative selection: Clone #14–12–2 and Clone #14–12–3.

human VHL gene was confirmed by RT-PCR of the reconstituted RNA transcript
from Clone #14–12–3 (d) with the primers VHLstart-F1/VHLexon-3R
(). The PCR product was sequenced
and found to match the correct human VHL sequence (). Note that in order for this mRNA reassembly to
work, the inserted DNA segments were designed so that the ∼60
bp recombination sites were located within introns, and were therefore
spliced out of the mature RNA transcript. At present, there are many methods to produce transgenic cells
for functional studies of genes. The most common methods rely on either
transfection of BAC DNA carrying a gene of interest into the host
cells or transduction with viruses. However, these methods lead to
random integrations into host chromosomes. As a result of that, the
expression level of genes varies greatly due to position effects and
the number of copies integrated. In addition, the use of viruses limits
the size of a gene that can be successfully transduced. Another popular
approach is based on integration of a gene into a “hot spot”
of a mammalian genome. In this case, homologous recombination for
targeting gene integration is very specific due to the usage of a
bacteriophage P1-derived Cre recombinase or ΦC31 integrase.
However, the efficiency of gene integration remains low. Furthermore,
integration of several genes into the same “hot spot”
is very difficult, if at all possible. Several years ago five groups developed a principally new approach
to produce transgenic cells. Their approach was to combine the usage of artificial chromosome-based
vectors with a multi-integrase system. This allowed homogeneous gene
expression without integration of the vector carrying the target genes
into host chromosomes. In addition, artificial chromosomes may be
transferred from one cell line to another cell line. Hence, once a
chromosome vector expressing a gene of interest was built, it could
be moved and used in many different cell lines. In this study, we developed a novel human artificial chromosome-based
system, the IIS-alphoid-HAC. This system utilizes two
compound markers termed GHT and PCF. Each compound marker is composed
of a positive selection marker, a counter selection marker and a fluorescence
marker. The GHT marker is composed of sequences encoding green fluorescence
protein (GFP), hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) and herpesvirus
thymidine kinase (Tk). The PCF marker is composed of sequences encoding
puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (Pac), red fluorescence protein (mCherry),
and a fusion protein of cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyl
transferase (FcyFur). These compound markers can be distinguished
visually and can be selected for or counter-selected against using
the appropriate drug. The IIS-alphoid-HAC system includes
three enzymes, Cre, ΦC31 and ΦBT1. Binding sites of these
enzymes are arranged in a manner that allows the IIS-alphoid-HAC to use a promoter capture and a marker exchange strategy to
assemble any desired number of genomic DNA segments. In this strategy,
the compound marker that is expressed switches each time a new DNA
segment is added to the platform cassette of the HAC. The compound
markers allow positive selection for cells where a new DNA segment
is added to the platform cassette and counter selection against the
cells when this event does not happen. Efficiency and accuracy of
the IIS-alphoid-HAC system has been demonstrated by
assembling a functional copy of the VHL gene from multiple DNA segments. The reassembly of genes from DNA segments by IIS requires breakage
and rejoining junctions to be made to the target gene. The optimal
placement of these junctions needs to fulfill several requirements.
First, the breakage-rejoining junctions must be placed within introns
of the target gene. This is necessary as spent integration sites (attR)
(<60 bp) are left between adjacent DNA segment (see ) during the gene assembly
process. Placement within introns, allows these integration sites
to be spliced out from mRNA and so avoid disruption to the exonic
coding sequence. http://regulatorygenomics.upf.edu/Software/SVM_BP/ http://regulatorygenomics.upf.edu/Software/SVM_BP/ Second, the placement of breakage-rejoining junctions must not
disrupt the splicing efficiency of its host intron. Hence, the breakage
and joining junction should not be near any features critical to intron
function such as the splice donor site, branchpoint sequence, poly
pyrimidine tract and the splice donor site. The spliced donor is on
the 5′ end of the intron and this is easily avoided by placing
the junction no closer than several hundred bp from it. The branchpoint
sequence and poly pyrimidine tract are typically 20–50 bp upstream
from the splice acceptor site (3′ end of intron). These sequences
can be avoided by placing the breakage-rejoining junction several
hundred bp upstream of the splice acceptor sequence. Splice site prediction
software can be used to identify the branch sequence (, or ). Third, insertion of the integrase sites at the breakage-rejoining
junctions should not generate a cryptic splice donor or acceptor site.
Splice prediction software such as  can help predict the creation of cryptic
splice site. Fourthly, it is envisioned that TAR cloning would be the preferred
method used to clone the gene segments. Hence, the breakage-rejoining
junctions must avoid repeat sequences. Repeat sequences can be identified
using the “Repeat mask” option in UCSC DNA download
window. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf Although several laboratories made a significant progress for synthetic
biology by constructing multi-integrase systems on different HACs
and MACs, a new IIS-alphoid-HAC system has some notable
advantages that set it apart from other similar artificial chromosome-based
systems (). First, the maximum number
of DNA segments that can be added to the IIS-alphoid-HAC is only limited by carrying capacity of a human chromosome,
which is several hundred Mbs. In effect the IIS-alphoid-HAC can insert any desired number of genomic DNA segments into the
construction platform located within the HAC. Second, each step of
insertion is accompanied by a change in cell color that simplifies
the selection of correct clones. Third, in this system the insertion
“scar” between adjacent DNA segments is greatly reduced
(<60 bp), consisting of a single recombined integration sites (attR)
that could, as shown here, be incorporated within introns to allow
reassembly a gene from multiple parts. Fourthly, IIS-alphoid-HAC has an error proofing mechanism to remove mis-incorporated DNA
segments and improve the integrity of assembly. Lastly, as we have
previously shown alphoid-HAC carrying
a gene(s) of interest can be removed from the cells in culture by
targeting with TetR fusion proteins that allow a unique possibility
to compare the phenotypes of human cells with and without a functional
copy of a gene(s) inserted into the HAC. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf For comparison, previously developed artificial chromosome-based
systems are limited to the number of efficient recombinases
known to work in mammalian cells (see ). As a result, the maximum number of fragments that may be inserted
into an artificial chromosome is low (five for the systems published
and would be approximately 10 if the systems were modified to use
all recombinases known to work in mammalian cells). In response, more
advanced systems were recently developed by the same group that could
perform unlimited multiple insertions (see ). However,
all these systems mentioned above retain and integrate the entire
plasmid backbone between DNA segments inserted into an artificial
chromosome. Therefore, they may experience problems assembling
functional genes from gene segments due to the presence of cryptic
splice sites or abnormal pausing of the splicing machinery that may
change splice isoform generation. Similar problems exist in another
artificial chromosome-based system (see ). Moreover, as this system uses multiple
(<50) identical platform cassettes integrated in the chromosome-vector,
the relative position of each new insert relative to one another is
uncontrolled. The maximum number of insertions that can be added is
limited by the number of platform cassettes, and is further reduced
because each round adds an additional loxP site that may recombine
and lead to destabilization of the chromosome upon Cre exposure. Another
system is based on the principles similar to our system (). However,
it has several significant distinctions: it does not include color
markers that help to distinguish one round of insertion from another;
it does not have an error proofing mechanism; the HAC cannot be specifically
and efficiently removed from the host cell cultures. In summary, the IIS-alphoid-HAC system is able to
efficiently and precisely carry out recombination in mammalian cells
that allows the investigator to potentially insert any desired number
of genomic fragments, leading to assembly of a functional copy of
a gene and even more complex loci. The IIS-alphoid-HAC
is a valuable unique genetic tool for investigating gene(s) function,
complex biochemical pathways and has a great potential for animal
transgenesis, development of therapeutic applications for complex
diseases, and synthetic biology. Chicken B-lymphoma DT40 cells
containing the alphoid-HAC were cultured in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (RPMI-1640, GIBCO) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Nuaille, France), 1% chicken
serum (Invitrogen), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (SIGMA) and 15 μg/mL
Blasticidin S (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) at 40 °C in 10% CO. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)-deficient
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (JCRB0218) carrying the alphoid-HAC were maintained in Ham’s F-12 nutrient mixture
(Invitrogen, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with 8 μg/mL
Blasticidin S Hydrochloride (Funakoshi, Japan). Blasticidin S is required
for stable propagation of alphoid-HAC in the medium. Construction of Plasmids for the IIS-alphoid-HAC
System http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf A037: The platform cassette plasmid was constructed
in two parts. The promoter and GHT marker components were amplified
from multiple plasmid sources while the recombinase recognition sites,
loxP and attB, ΦC31 were added by PCR using long oligomers.
The GHT compound marker is composed of a fusion of Green Fluorescence
Protein (GFP), P2A self-cleaving peptide, Hygromycin phosphotransferase
(hph) and viral Thymidine Kinase (TK). The Chr13 targeting hooks (M2A
and M2B) were PCR amplified from human genomic DNA and added to the
construct. The construction steps and primer sequences used are depicted

in three sections: (i) the integration cassette that comprises of
a promoterless compound marker with appropriate recombinase recognition
sites; (ii) the error proofing cassette, which is composed of an expressed
compound marker opposite to promoterless marker; (iii) the YAC-BAC
shuttle vector. Two compound markers were built, the GHT and PCF markers.
The GHT marker is as previously described while the PCF marker is
a fusion of Puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (Pac), 2A self-cleaving
peptide, mCherry fluorescence protein, a second 2A self-cleaving peptide,
and cytosine deaminase fused to uracil phosphoribosyl transferase
(FcyFur). The construction steps of the Type I carrier plasmid without
ARS (A167) and with ARS (A168) are shown in , respectively. The construction steps of the
Type II carrier plasmids without ARS (A169) and with ARS (A170) are

All construction primers used are listed in http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf A135-JH and A139: These are the vectors that express recombinases
ΦBT1 and Cre, ΦC31 and Cre, respectively. Each vector
expresses two recombinases as a single peptide, linked by a 2A-self-cleaving
peptide. The construction steps of A135-JH and A139 are shown in , respectively. All construction
primers used are listed in . Insertion of the Platform Cassette A037 into the Alphoid-HAC in Chicken DT40 Cells http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf The platform cassette
A037 was targeted into the human Ch13 segment present within alphoid-HAC using homologous recombination in a highly recombinogenic
chicken B-lymphoma DT40 cell line. Before targeting, the platform
cassette was digested and linearized by XhoI to release M2A (positions
Ch13:69420033–69523541; GRCH38/hg38) and M2B (positions Ch13:69523556–69527457;
GRCH38/hg38) hook sequences that have homology to the Ch13 segment.
90 clones were obtained under Hygromycin selection. PCR analysis of
genomic DNA from these clones using specific primers () confirmed insertion of the platform
cassette into the HAC in 14 of the clones. One Platform Cassette Per Alphoid-HAC, Per Cell http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00209/suppl_file/sb7b00209_si_001.pdf In order for the IIS-HAC system to stably work, only one platform
cassette can be present within the HAC and only one cassette within
the cell in total. Consequently several strategies and assays were
conducted to ensure there was only one platform cassette within the
HAC and cell. First, the platform cassette was inserted into a positon
within the HAC that was previously found to be unique, using homologous
recombination in chicken DT40 cell. Targeting was confirmed by PCRs.
Hence, there should only be one copy of the platform cassette in the
HAC. Second, the HAC containing the platform cassette was then transferred
from chicken DT40 to hamster CHO cells by MMCT, thereby removing any
copies of the platform cassette that may have integrated into the
genome of the DT40 cell. Third, we also conducted fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) in conjunction with colony subcloning to
ensure that the CHO cells we worked with had only a single HAC and
thus one copy of the platform cassette. Fourthly, the double selection
system of IIS innately selects against the presents of more than one
platform cassette. Hamster CHO cells, like many cancer cell line,
experience chromosome instability. Hence the copy number of the HAC
has been observed to spontaneously increase in a small percentage
of cells during culturing. This issue is addressed in the IIS-HAC-based
system by its compound markers that allow both positive selection
and negative counter-selection which are conducted at each round of
integration. More specifically, if there were two platform cassettes
expressing the GHT marker (GFP-hph-TK) in the HAC, the integration
of a DNA fragment with a promoterless PCF (Pac-mCherry-FcyFur) marker
into one cassette would result in a cell expressing the PCF marker
from one cassette and the GHT marker from the second cassette. The
double selection with both puromycin (positive selection for Pac)
and ganciclovir (counter-selection against TK) would remove such cells
with one or more platform cassettes. Only cells with one platform
cassette with the right compound marker can survive rounds of positive
selection and negative counter-selection. Lastly and more importantly,
PCR analysis of colonies from the integration of “empty vectors”
() yielded single bands, indicating
the presence of only one platform cassette. If there had been more
than one platform cassette within the HAC, after each integration
event, we should obtain more than one band in the PCR analysis, , one band for the platform cassette with the inset
and one without. Thus, we can conclude that our IIS-HAC-based integration
system has only one copy of inserted platform cassette. Microcell-Mediated Chromosome Transfer (MMCT) Technique The alphoid-HAC containing platform cassette A037
was moved from chicken DT40 cells to hamster CHO cells using an improved
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer technique. After MMCT transfer six clones were obtained. PCR of genomic
DNA isolated from these clones and FISH analysis confirmed the presence
of an autonomous HAC in five clones. Clone #CHO BH3:37 was selected
for further experiments. Fluorescence  Hybridization (FISH) FISH analysis was performed as following. Hamster CHO cells carrying
the alphoid-HAC bearing the platform cassette A037
were cultured in F12 medium with 10 μg/mL of colcemid (Invitrogen)
overnight at 37 °C. Metaphase cells were trypsinized and centrifugated
for 4 min at 172, treated in 10 mL of 50 mM KCl
hypotonic solution for 20 min at 37 °C and washed three times
in methanol:acetic acid (3:1) solution with a 4 min centrifugation
at 172 between each wash. Cells were diluted to
the appropriate density with fixative solution, spread onto precleaned
slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) above steam (boiling
water), and allowed to age 2 days at room temperature. For BAC probing,
CHO metaphase slides were washed in 70% formamide in 2× SSC for
2 min at 72 °C. Samples were dehydrated through a 70, 90, and
100% ethanol series for 4 min each and left to air-dry. The probe
used for FISH was BAC32–2-mer(tetO) DNA containing 40 kb of
alphoid-tetO array cloned into a BAC vector as described previously. BAC DNA was labeled using a nick-translation
kit with Orange 552 dUTP (5-TAMRA-dUTP) (Abbott Molecular). The probe
was denatured in hybridization solution at 78 °C for 10 min and
left at 37 °C for 30 min. The hybridization mix probe was applied
to the sample and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Slides were washed
with 0.4× SSC, 0.3% Tween 20 for 2 min at 72 °C, briefly
rinsed with 2× SSC, 0.1% Tween 20 (10 s) and air-dried in darkness.
The samples were counterstained with VECTASHIELD mounting medium containing
DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were analyzed
by fluorescence microscopy. Images were captured using a DeltaVision
imaging system in the CRC, LRBGE Fluorescence Imaging Facility (NIH)
and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). Plasmid DNA Transfection and Loading into Alphoid-HAC CHO cells with the alphoid-HAC were
cotransfected with Type I carrier plasmid A167 and A139 plasmid expressing
ΦC31 integrase and Cre recombinase for the first and third rounds
of insertion or with Type II carrier plasmid A169 and A135-JH plasmid
expressing ΦBT1 integrase and Cre recombinase for the second
round of insertion. Briefly 1 × 10 CHO cells were
seeded in one well of a 6-well plate in growth media without selection
antibiotics. Next day, 200 μL of Opti-MEM (Gibco), 6 μL
of X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche) 1.8 μg of
A167 and 0.2 μg of A139 or 1.8 μg A169 and 0.2 μg
A135-JH plasmids were mixed, incubated 20 min at room temperature
and added to the cells dropwise. Next day, the cells were trypsinized
and transferred to two 100 mm culture dishes with growth media containing
5 μg/mL Blasticidin S and 5 μg/mL Puromycin in case of
the first and third rounds of insertion or 5 μg/mL Blasticidin
S and 200 μg/mL Hygromycin B in the case of the second round.
The cells were cultured for 7–10 days until colonies of about
1 × 10 cells formed. Individual colonies were transferred
to a 24-well plate and cultured in media with 5 μg/mL Blasticidin
S, 5 μg/mL Puromycin and 10 μg/mL Ganciclovir or 5 μg/mL
Blasticidin S, 200 μg/mL Hygromycin B and 160 μg/mL 5-Fluorocytidine. Genomic DNA was extracted from CHO cultured
cells containing the alphoid-HAC with DNeasy Blood
& Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop
1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR mixture
included 0.5 μL TaKaRa LA Taq (5 units/μL, Clontech, #RR002M,
Lot KA3101CA), 5 μL 10× LA PCR Buffer, 8 μL dNTP
mixture (2.5 mM each), 300 ng of genomic DNA, 2 μL forward and
2 μL reverse primers (10 μM), sterile distilled water
up to 50 μL. PCR products were resolved on 1% or 2% agarose
gels. Construction of VHL Gene Fragment-Containing Plasmids and Loading

either exon 1, exon 2 or exon 3 of the VHL gene were PCR-amplified
from the TAR-isolated YAC/BAC clone containing a full-length genomic
copy of the VHL gene using specific primers
(). The fragments were cloned into
the appropriate plasmids as follows: a 5990 bp AscI-FseI fragment
1 containing exon 1 along with the VHL promoter was inserted into
Type 1 carrier vector A168 digested by AscI/FseI restriction enzymes;
a 4221 bp Asc1-Not1 fragment 2 containing exon 2 was inserted into
Type 2 carrier vector A170 digested by AscI/NotI restriction enzymes;
a 6323 bp Asc1-NotI fragment 3 containing exon 3 was inserted into
Type 1 carrier vector A168 digested by AscI/NotI restriction enzymes.
Three rounds of insertion were performed to assemble a full-length
VHL gene on the HAC. For the first round of insertion, 3 μg
of the exon 3-carrying vector and 2 μg of ΦC31-Cre-expressing
A139 vector were cotransfected into CHO cells carrying the alphoid-HAC bearing the previously inserted platform cassette

as a positive selection for 5 days and 4 μg/mL Puromycin, 4
μg/mL Blasticidin S and 5 μg/mL Gancyclovir were used
as a positive/negative selection for 1 week to select for correct
insertion of exon 3. For the second round of insertion, 3 μg
of exon 2-carrying vector and 2 μg of ΦBT1-Cre-expressing
A135-JH vector were cotransfected into CHO cells. 100 μg/mL

selection for 5 days. 100 μg/mL Hygromycin B, 4 μg/mL
Blasticidin S and 100 μg/mL 5-Fluorocytidine were used as a
positive/negative selection for 1 week to select for correct insertion
