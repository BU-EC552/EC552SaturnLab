Predicting hypothetical biochemical
reactions and catalyzing enzymes is needed to design novel pathways
in metabolic engineering and to fill knowledge gaps in our understanding
of metabolism. The ATLAS of Biochemistry is a database of known and predicted biochemical reactions that
was compiled by taking the biological data available in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and predicting the biochemical
reactions that would produce the contained compounds. Published in
2016, the utility of ATLAS has been recognized by several reviews
as a source of novel metabolic reactions for enzyme and metabolic
engineering. More recently, Yang  experimentally
validated hypothetical ATLAS reactions and used them to construct
novel one-carbon assimilation pathways. However, ATLAS was created based on the biochemical knowledge available
in KEGG 2015. Since then, KEGG has added
802 new metabolites, 918 new reactions, and 633 enzymes to its collection. The expansion of biochemical reactions within ATLAS relies on the
reaction prediction tool BNICE.ch (Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer), which consists
of (i) a large set of expert-curated, generalized reaction rules that
mimic the promiscuous activity of enzymes, and (ii) a network-generating
algorithm that applies the reaction rules to molecular structures
to generate possible biochemical reactions and compounds. The BNICE.ch
reaction rules can reconstruct known biochemical reactions, as well
as generate novel, hypothetical reactions. Currently, BNICE.ch has
400 bidirectional reaction rules that account for both the forward
and reverse reaction directionality. More than 130 000 novel
biochemical reactions between known biological compounds have been
predicted using this strategy. https://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/atlas https://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/atlas Herein, we integrated the new
KEGG 2018 data into our database
and expanded the biochemical space covered by ATLAS from 137 877
to 149 052 reactions. Interestingly, we found that the newly
available data validated 107 novel reactions predicted in ATLAS 2015.
In the following, we discuss the updated ATLAS statistics and illustrate
the improvements compared to the first version. The latest version
of ATLAS is available online (). To generate the new version of ATLAS,
we applied the BNICE.ch reaction rules to all of the metabolites available
in KEGG to generate all possible biochemically consistent reactions
between any two or more KEGG compounds. Two types of additional annotations
were performed on the generated reactions: First, the new ATLAS reactions
were curated with Gibbs free energy of reaction estimated with the
Group Contribution Method (GCM). Second,
the computational tool BridgIT was used to assign known enzymes to
novel, predicted reactions by comparing
the molecular structure of the participants in a novel, predicted
reaction to a database of known, well-curated reactions with full
gene-protein-reaction assignment. It calculates a similarity score
between the novel and the known reactions, which makes it possible
to find the enzyme with the highest probability of catalyzing the
novel reaction. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00052/suppl_file/sb0c00052_si_001.xlsx Since
2015, two main aspects
of our workflow have been updated, which were applied to generate
the updated version of ATLAS. First, the set of bidirectional reaction
rules was increased from 360 to 400. Second, we applied the most recent
version of BridgIT to predict putative enzymes for novel compounds,
and we report the top three enzyme matches for each. The 40 new rules
were created to reconstruct the exact reaction mechanism of an additional
number of 510 KEGG reactions that were not considered previously (, KEGG reaction R03223) (). Marvin was used for drawing, displaying, and characterizing
chemical structures, substructures and reactions, Marvin 17.28.0,
2017, ChemAxon (). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00052/suppl_file/sb0c00052_si_001.xlsx ATLAS 2018, based on KEGG 2018,
now has 149 052 reactions,
out of which 5779 are known to KEGG. Compared to 2015, we added 385
known and 11 173 novel reactions (). Thanks to the predicted reactions, ATLAS now integrates
4587 out of 9857 disconnected, or “orphan”, KEGG metabolites,
which were not participating in any known biochemical reaction. Increased Coverage
of KEGG Reactions The KEGG database
contained 18 254 compounds as of February 2018 (). In a first preprocessing
step, we removed 999 compounds without clearly defined molecular structures
(, polymers, proteins). The filtered data set
comprised 17 255 compounds, out of which 9857 were not involved
in any KEGG reaction. These orphan compounds did not participate in
any known biotransformation in the KEGG metabolic space. Out of the 10 829 reactions in KEGG, 76 involved
compounds
with an undefined structure that were removed, resulting in a filtered
set of 10 753 reactions. Out of these, 8118 reactions were
reconstructed with BNICE.ch reaction rules. We observed three different
types of reaction reconstruction: 5779 reactions were exactly reconstructed,
meaning that the reactions generated by BNICE.ch use the same cofactors
as in KEGG. Another 1705 reactions were reconstructed using alternative
cofactors, out which 123 reactions were poorly characterized in KEGG
(, reaction mechanism not known, incomplete reaction).
The remaining 634 reactions were reconstructed in two (408 reactions),
three (145 reactions), or four (81 reactions) consecutive reaction
steps. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00052/suppl_file/sb0c00052_si_001.xlsx A total of 2635 KEGG reactions were not reconstructed
with BNICE.ch
(). First, 1546 reactions did not
fulfill the BNICE.ch requirements for reconstruction, such as reactions
involving polymer structures, generic compounds, or compounds without
a defined molecular structure, as well as elementally unbalanced reactions
and stereoisomerase reactions. Additionally, the reaction rules are
organized according to the Enzyme Classification (EC) system, so each
reconstructed or predicted reaction is automatically assigned a third-level
EC number corresponding to the nonsubstrate specific EC classification
of the reconstructing reaction rule. Another 308 reactions had partial
or missing EC number annotations, indicating that the reaction mechanisms
are not known and therefore no rule has been created for these reactions.
The remaining 862 reactions were not reconstructed because their reaction
mechanisms are very specific and hence not readily generalizable. Overview of Compound, Reaction, and
Enzyme Statistics in KEGG and ATLAS Number of bidirectional enzymatic
reaction rules Number of orphan compounds integrated in
ATLAS Number of matches between the EC
assignment from the reaction rules and the EC numbers assigned by
BridgIT for novel reactions in ATLAS. Predicted ATLAS Reactions Validated in KEGG and Other Databases To validate the predicted reactions in ATLAS, we analyzed the novel
reactions predicted in 2015 that became known in KEGG 2018. Out of
the 958 reactions newly added to KEGG, only 239 reactions involved
compounds that were already present in KEGG 2015, meaning that they
could have been predicted in the original ATLAS. Out of these 239
reactions, 107 were already present in ATLAS. In other words, the
existence of hypothetical reactions in ATLAS 2015 was confirmed in
KEGG 2018, demonstrating the predictive power of BNICE.ch. Next,
we examined the enzymes that BridgIT suggested in ATLAS 2015 for these
107 novel reactions, out of which 75 had an enzyme assigned. Interestingly,
we found that the predicted EC numbers for 64 out of 75 reactions
match the EC number proposed in KEGG up to the third level. For example,
the novel reaction rat104204 was predicted to have an EC number of
2.4.1.-. BridgIT suggested R08946 as the most similar reaction, which
was known to be catalyzed by 2.4.1.245. In 2018, KEGG confirmed the
promiscuous activity of 2.4.1.245 for this reaction and named it R11306. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00052/suppl_file/sb0c00052_si_001.xlsx In ATLAS 2018, we additionally mapped the novel reactions to reaction
databases other than KEGG. Interestingly, we found that 1118 predicted
reactions in ATLAS were not actually novel, but known to at least
one of the repositories Brenda, Reactome, HMR, MetaCyc, MetaNetX,
BIGG, or Rhea, which shows that the predictive power of ATLAS goes
beyond KEGG (). ATLAS reactions
that can be found in any of these databases are linked accordingly
in the updated version. Improvements in the Prediction of Enzymes
for ATLAS Reactions To find putative enzymes for the reactions
in ATLAS, we applied
the enzyme prediction tool BridgIT. With the latest version of the
tool, the new predictions were significantly better in the updated
ATLAS: BridgIT correctly matched 92% of ATLAS reactions to the same
EC class as BNICE.ch rules, whereas the previous version only matched
around 60% (). For each ATLAS reaction, we provide the top three candidate enzymes,
and we also include BridgIT results for known KEGG reactions to provide
alternative enzymes for a known reaction. As a qualitative example
of an improved prediction, we analyzed the ATLAS reaction rat109456,
whose closest BridgIT candidate had a low matching score of 0.67.
In ATLAS 2018, the reaction is now known and BridgIT found three very
similar reactions, the first of which having a higher score than in
the previous version (). Reaction with ATLAS identifier rat109456 is an example of a reaction
that was novel in ATLAS 2015 and that is now cataloged in KEGG. (left)
In ATLAS 2015, the earlier version of BridgIT provided the most similar
known reaction, and associated enzyme, for the ATLAS reaction with
the ID. (right) In ATLAS 2018, the same reaction is now cataloged
in KEGG as R11332 with EC 5.3.1.33. Other than the native enzyme with
EC 5.3.1.33, BridgIT provides three alternative enzyme candidates
that might also catalyze the reaction. We have updated the ATLAS of Biochemistry to
integrate new biochemical
data from KEGG 2018 using an updated set of generalized reaction rules
and by employing an improved version of BridgIT to enhance the enzyme
predictions for novel reactions. This study demonstrates the dynamic
nature of biochemical knowledge and highlights the need for continuous
updates of database-dependent applications. The updated ATLAS database
contributes to fill the gaps in our current knowledge of metabolism
by expanding the boundaries to novel predicted metabolic reactions.
