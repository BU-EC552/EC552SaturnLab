As the desire to construct ever
more complex synthetic gene circuits grows, the robust performance
of requisite parts becomes ever more important. Genetic circuits often
exploit transcription factors to encode logic function. The expression of such regulatory proteins can place a significant
metabolic burden upon the host cell due to the cost of translation
and ribosome sequestration with up to 50% of cellular energetic resources
allocated to translation. Minimizing the cost
of genetic circuitry is a major challenge to the expansion of synthetic
biology. The use of “ribo-regulation”
has become a promising
alternative to traditional transcription-factor-based systems for
heterologous gene expression control. These systems include ribozymes, ribo-regulators, synthetic toehold switches, and riboswitches which function
without any requirements for accessory proteins. The use of post-transcriptional
regulation provides an additional point of control, allowing fine-tuning
of expression rates. Current methods for tuning genetic circuits often
achieve this by modification of the promoter and/or the ribosome binding
site (RBS). These approaches often require iterative cloning
and screening to select for the desired regulatory function. The use
of small molecule inducible systems such as inducible promoters can
be used to circumvent this need, but these systems often suffer from
high basal expression. Riboswitches
are naturally occurring RNA structures found in the
5′ UTR of bacterial genes capable
of binding a wide array of small molecules, including synthetic inducer ligands. RNA devices have been engineered and selected to respond to environmental
culture conditions such as pH and a wide array of
noncognate ligands using  and  selection methods. Riboswitches have been employed in directed evolution and metabolic engineering. Additionally, riboswitches have been shown to function across a
range of bacterial species and even in eukaryotic
organisms. Riboswitches consist of
two functional domains, a ligand binding
aptamer, and a signal actuator, termed the expression platform. In
the case of translation activating riboswitches, ligand binding within the aptamer initiates
a structural rearrangement of the expression platform by strand displacement
of the RBS sequestering (anti-RBS) sequence, leading to RBS release
and translation initiation (A). A number of studies have attempted to capitalize
on this bipartite structure by inserting aptamer domains upstream
from terminator stems to generate riboswitches with modified transcription
termination functionality. Riboswitches provide
a number of attractive advantages: (i) heterologous protein expression
places a significant burden on the cellular metabolism; therefore, cis-regulation RNA-mediated control
of expression reduces cellular burden, as protein production is not required for function. (ii) Additionally, post-transcriptional regulation at the
RNA level removes dependence on accessory protein, allowing a rapid
regulatory response. (iii) Attenuation of expression levels using
a single clone, rather than relying on RBS modification, reduces the
need for library development and screening. Taken together, the integration of riboswitches into the 5′UTR
should allow the user to quickly obtain dynamic regulation of any
given gene of interest. However, there are a
number of additional challenges to the use
of riboswitches. Translation initiation from an RBS is influenced
by synonymous codon usage of the flanking 5′ coding sequence,
and this context dependency has gained a lot attention in recent years, with a number of studies using insulator regions and mechanisms
to address this problem. In addition to this
genetic context-dependency, the function of expression systems is
also known to be sensitive to contextual changes in environment such
as temperature, population density, or metabolic state. To build systems which function as robustly
as possible, it is important to understand how both these genetic
and environmental changes can affect protein production and regulatory
performance. There are also a number of specific challenges to riboswitch
engineering, namely sensitivity of function to the surrounding sequence
context. In addition, the potential for complex interplay
between different riboswitch conformations means predictive molecular
engineering is currently challenging. In some translational
riboswitches such as the adenine binding  riboswitch
from  and the related pyrimido-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine
(PPDA) responsive orthogonal riboswitch (ORS), this is further complicated
by overlap of functional regions within the riboswitch at the junction
between the RBS sequestering hairpin and the basal stem of the aptamer. These overlapping regions are
essential for the formation of the mutually exclusive OFF and ON structures
(A) because
the RBS sequestering sequence (anti-RBS) is directly involved in formation
of the OFF structure. Previous studies have selected artificial
expression platforms
to generate functional riboswitches from an aptamer, using fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
methods. Genetic selection has been applied to improve
riboswitch function through expression platform engineering. Guided by this work and the riboswitch design rules generated following
statistical analysis of  folding experimental
performance metrics, we sought to re-engineer
the ORS to achieve high levels of gene expression under conditions
of riboswitch activation and to minimize riboswitch expression in
the absence of induction while considering the context dependencies
which affect RBS riboswitch function. To achieve
this, we set out to improve performance in a structured and systematic
manner using a combination of genetic design variables and environmental
factors using Design of Experiments (DoE). DoE was originally
laid out as an essential principle of experimentation. By designing structured experiments, it becomes
possible to assess both the effects of factors (genetic and environmental
variables, in the case of biology) as well as the interactions between
these factors, while efficiently mapping the entire multidimensional
landscape of experimental space. DoE has been applied across a range
of fields, including bioprocessing and metabolic engineering. The complex structure of many designed experiments has previously
prohibited the use of DoE within biomolecular engineering for exploration
of sequence-function landscapes. With the advent of cheap and accurate
DNA synthesis, recent years have begun to see the use of DoE in synthetic
biology but with only a few studies exploring sequence level optimization
or characterization. Here, we describe the use
of a high-throughput flow-cytometer-based
selection method coupled with DoE for the selection and characterization
of the post-transcriptional regulatory RNA devices. This methodology
has been used in this study to enhance the function of the ORS. This
riboswitch device was selected for development due to its simple structure,
relatively modular structure, PPDA solubility, and orthogonality of
the ligand from cellular metabolism. We
demonstrate that these improved variants afford high levels of translational
control across an array of settings and use DoE to explore the sensitivity
of riboswitch function to environmental and genetic alterations (B). The most robust
device was then selected for further testing in a wide selection of
genetic contexts. Engineering of the PPDA responsive orthogonal

Protein production is activated in response to pyrimido[4,5-]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine (PPDA), which causes a change in
the secondary structure of the eGFP 5′UTR, allowing translation
to proceed. (B) An overview of the screening and optimization workflow

This functional enhancement enabled development of four stress responsive
riboswitch devices. (C) Schematic overview of a synthetic riboswitch
device under regulation of the IPTG inducible P promoter
showing transcriptional and translational regulation of an N-terminally
His tagged eGFP. Previously,
we showed that through optimization of N-terminal synonymous
codon usage we enhanced riboswitch function. However, although good riboswitch-dependent control was observed,
the developed riboswitches exhibited low total expression levels.
To further enhance the utility of riboswitches, we set out to achieve
vertical extension of the riboswitch-dependent dose response curves
by increasing the maximum level of protein production and allowing
access to a greater proportion of the total gene expression landscape. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf To improve riboswitch function, we aimed to further improve the
performance by increasing the translation initiation rate (TIR) when
the riboswitch is activated by ligand binding (A). In this study, the ORS was placed downstream
of the isopropyl β--1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
inducible P promoter and upstream of an N-terminally
His-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (C). Expression performance
was assessed by considering gene expression levels under the following
conditions: full riboswitch and promoter induction (ON, 100 μM
IPTG and 1000 μM PPDA), expression in the absence of riboswitch
induction (OFF, IPTG 100 μM), and basal expression under uninduced
conditions (UI). Riboswitch-dependent control and total gene expression
control are determined from the respective ratios ON/OFF and ON/UI.
To increase the TIR from the ORS, we modified the region containing
the predicted native RBS (AGAGAA), −10 to −4 nucleotide
relative to the start codon (A) contained with the
expression platform region of the riboswitch. We first validated the
location of the predicted RBS in the absence of the riboswitch (ΔRS)
by mutating the native RBS to the same sequence as the 16S rRNA (TCCTCC)
(, ), termed the nonfunctional RBS (NF_RBS). Assessment
of protein expression from the NF_RBS showed that this alteration
greatly affected expression, resulting in very low levels of reporter
protein signal when induced with IPTG (RFU/OD = 208) compared to the
WT_RBS (RFU/OD = 2436) (B and ). Following
confirmation of the RBS within the ΔRS construct, we exchanged
the −10 to −4 nucleotide sequence with the  consensus RBS sequence (AGGAGG) (con_RBS). The predicted RBS strengths of the WT_RBS and the con_RBS were 811.1
au and 21546.3, respectively (Salis RBS calc. v 2.0). Measurement of the reporter protein levels from the con_RBS construct
showed high levels of expression compared to WT_RBS and NF_RBS, with
an increase of 5.5- and 64.5-fold, respectively (B). Following induction with
IPTG expression from con_RBS reached 13425 RFU/OD with a dynamic rage
(± IPTG) of 11.5-fold, demonstrating that we had successfully
been able to achieve a gain of function with substitution of native
RBS with the consensus RBS. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Supporting Information and Methods http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf In light of the successful increase
in TIR, the con_RBS sequence
was incorporated into an orthogonal riboswitch-containing construct
(, , and ). Comparison of protein production
from the ORS constructs containing the WT RBS (ORS-WT_RBS) and the
consensus RBS (ORS-con_RBS) induced with IPTG (100 μM) and PPDA
(1000 μM) showed that after 3 h the maximal (ON) expression
levels were 7.5-fold higher for ORS-con_RBS. However, riboswitch-dependent
(ON/OFF) control was further reduced from 4-fold to 2-fold (B). As a control,
we designed an anti-RBS sequence (CCUCCC) with perfect complementary
sequence to the consensus RBS (anti-con_RBS) (). This showed poor function with very
low OFF and ON expression and no PPDA-dependent regulation of expression
(B). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Riboswitch function is determined by a fine balance between at
least two competing RNA structures to afford ON and OFF switching
function. Ligand binding causes a conformational change, resulting
in a change in stability of the expression platform. The free energies
involved in this structural rearrangement have been finely tuned by
evolution, making rational design highly challenging. To address these difficulties, we employed a high-throughput
FACS-based selection/counter selection methodology to identify riboswitches
with optimal OFF and ON states. First, an anti-RBS clonal library
with degenerate nucleotides at positions −36 to −31
was generated by isothermal assembly using a synthetic ssDNA input
library (4 possible variants) () (A). The
library was screened with two rounds of FACS using selection and counter
selection (±PPDA) to isolate clones with enhanced riboswitch-dependent
control () (B, ). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Following FACS selection, 180
colonies were screened for function
after induction with IPTG (100 μM) ± PPDA (200 μM)
for 3 h (single replicate only, ). Of these, the 20 best performers were taken forward
for sequencing and further expression testing. FACS screening of the
anti-RBS library successfully yielded riboswitches with a wide range
of function (C). A 223-fold range of ON performance was observed with relative
expression values between 104 RFU/OD for HL-H3 to 23271 RFU/OD for
LH-F9 (C, left -axis). In addition, a diverse range of riboswitch dependent
fold change (ON/OFF) was observed (3 h induction, 30 °C) with
clones displaying no riboswitch-dependent control (HL-H3) up to 16-fold
(LH-D4) (C,
right -axis). This riboswitch-dependent control
is a significant improvement in both performance relative to the original
riboswitch (ORS-WT_RBS), the riboswitch containing the consensus RBS
(ORS-con_RBS), and the riboswitch with the consensus RBS perfect complementary
anti-RBS sequence (anti-con_RBS) which displayed 4.4-fold, 2.0-fold,
and 1.3-fold, respectively. Coupled with the increased expression
level, this gain of function greatly improves the function of the
ORS. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf The isolation of these riboswitches demonstrates the utility
of
the FACS sorting protocol for selecting a diverse range of functional
riboswitches. Further comparison of riboswitch dependent fold change
(ON/OFF) and total fold change (ON/UI) function for all functional
FACS selected variants showed that the two best performers for ON/OFF
and ON/UI were LH-G7 and LH-D4 (D4-ORS) (D). Sanger sequencing of the functional variants
was performed, and structural prediction analysis of the D4-ORS was
performed (). The
anti-RBS sequences and expression performance of each variant can
be found in . To rationalize,
predict, and perform forward molecular engineering of riboswitches
with enhanced dynamic range, it is important to understand the respective
ON and OFF conformations. For example, if a given anti-RBS variant
binds too tightly to an RBS, then the expression platform may remain
in an OFF conformation even when the aptamer is ligand-bound. Similarly,
a weakly bound RBS–anti-RBS hairpin may lead to an expression
platform that remains in an ON even when the aptamer is not ligand-bound.
However,  prediction of ligand-bound riboswitch
conformations remains a significant challenge. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf To rationalize
the performance of new anti-RBS–consensus
RBS variants, they were subjected to  folding
analysis to predict the structural stability
of the OFF and ON states of the ORS expression platform. The minimum
free energy of the OFF state (Δ OFF) was predicted
using the full-length expression platform and the 5′ of the
coding sequence (−45 nt to +60 nt). This sequence was then
truncated  to remove the aptamer region
of the riboswitch (−36 to +60 nt) as a proxy for the ON state
sequence, in a manner similar to that used in Kent et al. (). By using
this sequence, the structural predictions allow interrogation of the
expression platform when the riboswitch is in the activated RBS-released
state. The minimum free energy was then predicted using RNAfold (Δ ON) and the difference
between the two minimum free energies was then calculated (ΔΔ (kcal/mol) (). These features make this an essential region in predicting riboswitch
function; by using this  prediction, we
hope to further understand the dynamic interplay between the OFF and
ON state of the expression platform. The ΔΔ of each functional variant shows a correlation with riboswitch-dependent
control ( = 0.56,  = 7.7 ×
10) (). To further assess the performance of the ORS, D4-ORS,
we explored
the effect of (i) exchanging the flanking coding sequence, (ii) transcription
levels, and (iii) environmental factors. Previously, we demonstrated
the context sensitivity of the ORS (ORS-WT_RBS) upon downstream coding
sequence through the modification of synonymous codon usage. This previous study revealed that riboswitch-dependent
performance was dependent upon and could be rationalized on the basis
of calculated structural/stability features of the riboswitch and
that a fine balance was required in the relative stabilities of the
respective ON and OFF conformations to achieve optimal riboswitch
performance. Often when producing proteins it is desirable to modify
environmental conditions or factors as well as genetic ones to achieve
optimal expression and control, for example, lower incubation temperatures
to improve folding of recombinant proteins. Typically, the performance
of genetic elements or factors is evaluated under fixed environmental
conditions. While this approach may yield constructs which function
under these conditions, engineered strains and devices may fail to
perform robustly under alternative environmental conditions. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Testing all possible combinations of these
factors would be challenging,
but by applying a DoE (), we aimed
to robustly test and optimize the behavior of the D4-ORS-con_RBS while
simultaneously exploring the effect of multiple genetic and environmental
factors. The selected factors were: transcription level (IPTG concentration)
( = 3), incubation temperature (°C) ( = 3), predicted TIR ( = 2), predicted
anti-RBS:RBS hairpin stability (ΔΔ kcal/mol)
( = 3) based on minimum free energies calculated
from the anti-RBS–consensus RBS variants (isolated using FACS),
and N-terminal synonymous codon usage ( = 4) (A). Four of the previously identified selected N-terminal
codon usage variants were tested with the D4-ORS. The selected codon
usage variants were variant linker 30 (L30), linker (L35), linker
36 (L36), and linker 32 (L32). For details
on the DoE factor levels and data types, see . The use of the fractional factorial D-optimal DoE
facilitated a 5.4-fold reduction (216 experiments to 40) in the required
number of experiments. For details on the generated experimental design,
see . Ribosome binding
site engineering () and  analysis () of the best performing FACS variants
highlights the importance of balancing TIR modification with the complementarity
of the anti-RBS. To allow integration of this design consideration
into the DoE, the final genetic factor explored was the ΔΔ of the RBS sequestering structure. By using this  metric, we were able to treat this design factor
as a continuous data type, allowing reduction of the required number
of experimental runs. Data for the structured experimental design of reporter protein
production was collect after 24 h (). This data shows a large distribution in uninduced (UI), OFF and
ON expression levels (B). Comparison of the expression data shows that the factors
tested greatly affect the riboswitch-dependent fold change (ON/OFF)
and total fold change (ON/UI) in expression, changes in ON/OFF ranging
from 2.5- up to an impressive 78.1-fold, and ON/UI control between
7.9- and 698-fold. Initial investigation of the optimal expression
conditions show that plotting ON/OFF against ON/UI (C) shows that run #20 yields
the best trade-off between these two responses, while #4 and #20 show
similar ON/OFF performance. However, #4 shows a reduced total fold
change (ON/UI = 512). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx To allow improved investigation and understanding
of the multidimensional
data set generated from the DoE, a standard least squares (SLS) regression
model was fit to the multifactorial expression data set (). ANOVA was used to assess the importance
of each factor in the model; significant effects and interactions
were selected based on the Log worth statistic, and unimportant factors
were removed from the model (). This refined model facilitated deeper investigation into
the effects of multiple factors on the four response metrics (OFF,
ON, ON/OFF, and ON/UI). The SLS regression highlights the first order
effects and second order interactions, which are significant in explaining
each of the four responses (). This modeling allows us to formalize several interesting
observations about riboswitch expression dynamics. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf The generated
explanatory model showed that across all four responses,
the highly significant ( < 5 × 10) factors and interactions were the ON/OFF stability (ΔΔ) of the anti-RBS-RBS hairpin, the interaction between
TIR and hairpin ΔΔ, TIR, and IPTG concentration
(). Several other
interactions were also significant ( < 0.01)
(). To test the explanatory
power of this statistical model, the prediction for each response
was plotted against the actual performance (), showing that the explanatory model fits the data
set well (OFF  = < 1 × 10,  = 0.87, root mean squared error
(RSME) = 883.7; ON  = < 1 × 10 ,  = 0.86, RSME = 6140.3; ON/OFF  = < 1 × 10 ,  = 0.93, RSME = 8.0; ON/UI  = <
1 × 10 ,  =
0.85, RSME = 77.7). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Once the explanatory power of the model
had been shown, we set
out to investigate the multidimensional, multiresponse data set using
the model projections of each respective response. By setting the
desired response optimization criteria (minimize OFF expression and
maximize ON expression, ON/OFF, and ON/UI, ) interrogation of the standard least squares regression
reveals factors with optimal OFF, ON, ON/OFF, and ON/UI performance.
Details of the model coefficients for each factor used to build the
refined model and the effect of these factors on the individual response
variables can be found in . As expected, RBS strength has a significant impact upon
both the OFF ( = 2.8 × 10) and ON ( = 1.5 × 10) expression levels with the strongest RBS (con_RBS) affording a
large increase in ON (). Increasing IPTG concentration also has a significant positive
effect on both OFF ( = 4.6 × 10) and ON ( = 4.6 × 10),
leading to an increase in both responses with a larger effect upon
ON expression than OFF (). Interestingly the model predicts that both RBS strength and hairpin
ΔΔ have a significant positive effect
upon riboswitch dependent control (RBS strength  = 7.6 × 10, hairpin ΔΔ = 2.0 × 10) (, blue boxes).
The interaction between these two factors also has a significant effect
on ON/OFF function ( = 5.2 × 10) and significantly increase total fold change (RBS strength  = 1.0 × 10, hairpin ΔΔ = 7.2 × 10). Together, these factor effects suggest that the improved riboswitch
function is a byproduct of increasing ON expression while also reducing
OFF and UI expression through proper formation of the anti-RBS hairpin
OFF state. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx A number of other interacting factors impact OFF
and ON expression
levels. The concentration of IPTG used shows an additive effect on
both OFF and ON expression when used with the stronger RBS (OFF  = 5.9 × 10, ON  = 4.8 × 10), meaning that when a stronger
RBS is used, the effect of IPTG induction is enhanced, leading to
higher expression both in the absence and presence of riboswitch activation.
Increasing hairpin stability (ΔΔ) leads
to a reduction in the impact of the IPTG effect on OFF expression
( = 4.1 × 10), which means
a more stable hairpin reduces the leaky expression from the unactivated
riboswitch (). Intuitively,
this observation seems to indicate that leaky expression from the
riboswitches is caused by nonoptimal anti-RBS hairpin formation in
the absence of the ligand (i.e., too weak/low ΔΔ), and that by increasing the ΔΔ of the hairpin, this leaky expression can therefore be reduced even
at higher levels of transcription. Additionally, RBS strength and
hairpin ΔΔ significantly interact, effecting
both OFF ( = 5.6 × 10)
and ON ( = 1.0 × 10) expression
with the larger effect on OFF expression, suggesting that the importance
of proper anti-RBS hairpin formation is greater when a strong RBS
is used. In more practical terms, this means that any transcript which
forms a ligand-bound ORS riboswitch structure produces greater levels
of eGFP when translation is regulated by the strong consensus RBS. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf The set of experimental conditions that best satisfy all four response
criteria is DoE run #20 (C, ). The plasmid construct used in this run consists of the D4-ORS
riboswitch, N-terminal linker L36, induced with 200 μM IPTG
at 30 °C. With these parameter settings, the model achieves an
optimal balance between OFF, ON, ON/OFF, and ON/UI. However, the model
suggests an interesting, albeit small, interaction between two factors.
We see that the N-terminal linker L36 has a significant effect on
this performance metric, but only when we consider it as part of an
interaction with the incubation temperature ( =
3.0 × 10). The effect of this predicted interaction
was initially investigated  by modification
of the experimental parameter settings to study the effect of this
predicted interaction upon riboswitch function (). We see that when linker L36 (A) is used in the
model, projections show an effect of temperature, with a higher incubation
temperature having a negative effect on ON/OFF and ON/UI performance.
While the predicted ON/OFF and ON/UI of the D4-ORS-L36 is largely
unchanged when incubated at 30 °C, the real effect of this interaction
occurs when temperature is increased to 37 °C. If we instead
use the L35 linker with the D4-ORS, then the ON/OFF and ON/UI performance
shows a reduced temperature dependency (B) with the ON/UI performance being better
maintained, irrespective of the induction temperature. The expression landscape of D4-ORS-L35 in response to both
IPTG
and PPDA was mapped (D), and the total fold change is shown in E. This confirmed that D4-ORS-L35
displayed high levels of IPTG and PPDA dependent regulation and displays
AND logic behavior with expression requiring the addition of both
IPTG and PPDA. An optimal ON/UI of 500-fold was observed with 1000
μM PPDA and 200 μM IPTG. Further investigation of the
expression response surface suggested that at 200 μM, IPTG maximal
ON expression is achieved, but also that this IPTG concentration leads
to an increase in the OFF expression, compared to those cells induced
with 40 μM IPTG (D). Indeed, at an intermediate IPTG concentration (100 μM)
(C), D4-ORS-L35
gave consistent ON expression but reduced OFF expression, affording
improved ON/OFF performance of 72-fold and total expression control
of 544-fold (D). This highlights the need to balance transcriptional and post-transcriptional
induction to properly achieve optimal riboswitch performance. To demonstrate the regulatory improvements achieved, the expression
of the optimized constructs (D4-ORS-L35 and D4-ORS-L36) and the original
ORS construct (ORS-WT_RBS-L30) (C and D) were compared. Fluorescence quantification
after 24 h of induction confirmed that the optimized constructs showed
drastically improved performance compared to the original ORS construct.
The impact of changing the N-terminal linker was then validated by
comparing riboswitch performance of the D4-ORS-L36 and D4-ORS-L35
at 37 °C induced with 100 μM IPTG ± 1000 μM
PPDA. These results confirmed that D4-ORS-L36 shows reduced performance
at 37 °C when compared to D4-ORS-L35. To assess the expression
profile of the D4-ORS construct at a single-cell
level, we used flow cytometry to measure cellular eGFP fluorescence.
This allowed us to assess the heterogeneity of eGFP expression 24
h after induction with IPTG ± PPDA. Here, we compared the performance
of the D4-ORS-L35 with ΔRS-conRBS-L35 (E and F). In the absence of any induction,
we see two subpopulations in the ΔRS-conRBS-L35, one with low
fluorescence (median = 332 RFU, 7.7% of events) and a second, broad
population with higher fluorescence (median = 5661 RFU, 92.3% of events).
If we compare this uninduced population with that of the D4-ORS-L35,
this shows a single population of cells with low fluorescence (median
= 265 RFU). Once induced with IPTG the ΔRS-conRBS-L35 shows
strong induction (10 μM IPTG, median = 63 996, IPTG 100
μM 143 785). Upon induction of D4-ORS-L35 with 8, 40,
200, and 1000 μM PPDA and a fixed IPTG concentration of 100
μM, we see titratable regulation of protein production with
the median fluorescence measurements from expressing cells reaching
1687 RFU, 4352 RFU, 16 326, and 55 543 RFU, respectively.
We also observed a small, low fluorescent subpopulation following
IPTG and PPDA addition, which represents between 7–10% of the
total cellular population. Due to the complexity of interactions
between genetic and environmental
factors, selection of the best riboswitch design is not as simple
as combining the best expression platform with the best N-terminal
linker. By identifying the temperature–linker
interaction, we selected the final device based on both performance
and robustness. This effect would have been difficult to identify
using a more traditional “one factor at a time” method,
thus supporting our use of a Design of Experiments approach in the
multifactorial, multiobjective selection and optimization of this
RNA device. For reasons of apparent robustness, the D4-ORS-L35 construct
was selected as the best candidate for further evaluation and characterization. To test the robustness of the D4-ORS-L35 with an alternative gene
of interest, we exchanged the eGFP for the alternative reporter protein
mKate2 and assayed riboswitch performance (). The D4-ORS riboswitch showed consistently improved performance
compared to the original riboswitch with an increase in both ON and
ON/OFF (A).
However, in spite of very similar OFF and ON expression, the D4-ORS
riboswitch with an alternative linker L32 performs marginally better
when it comes to fold change (ON/OFF = 59) than D4-ORS-L35 (ON/OFF
= 53) (A).
Despite the inconsistent rank performance of the optimal N-terminal
linkers when expressing the two different reporter genes, both D4-ORS-L35
and D4-ORS-L32 show high levels of riboswitch-dependent control over
the expression of mKate2, making both viable tools for post-transcriptional
regulation of protein expression. This performance is vastly improved
relative to the original ORS riboswitch that has an ON/OFF performance
of just 12-fold and demonstrates that the D4-ORS robustly provides
enhanced regulatory performance regardless of the gene being regulated. It may often be beneficial to integrate regulatory devices
into
the genome of the chassis to reduce genetic instability caused by
plasmid maintenance, and to remove the need to maintain selective
pressure through the use of antibiotics. We next wanted to investigate
the function of the D4-ORS-L35 riboswitch when inserted into the genome
(). The native WT-ORS performs poorly
when integrated into the genome, with very low expression levels (UI
= 10 RFU/OD, OFF = 19, ON = 49) and poor riboswitch-dependent control
(ON/OFF = 3.4-fold) (B). However, by using the optimized D4-ORS-L35 we are able
to regulate expression of the gene of interest from a single copy
present on the genome (UI = 9, OFF = 26, ON = 598), affording riboswitch-dependent
and total control overexpression of 23-fold and 70-fold respectively
(B). By optimizing
the function of these riboswitches, it is now possible to use riboswitch
from a genomic locus, and obtain high levels of control and tight
basal expression. This development greatly expands the utility of
the PPDA responsive riboswitch. To establish whether the optimized
riboswitch would provide enhanced
function when the aptamer was replaced, we exchanged the ORS aptamer
domain for the related 2-aminopurine (2-AP) responsive  aptamer domain from  (A). When the con_RBS
is present, we observe ON expression far higher than previously reported, affording a 29-fold total fold change. However,
as expected without the cognate anti-RBS, the OFF expression level
is also very high, and poor riboswitch-dependent control is observed.
The  aptamer was then assessed with the D4 expression
platform and linker (L35, L36, and L32) combinations. These re-engineered  riboswitches show tight basal expression and high ON
expression with ON/UI of 162-fold, 167-fold, and 193-fold, respectively.
However, while the ON/UI shows good function, the ON/OFF performance
of the D4-addA was reduced in comparison to the D4-ORS variants (7.6-,
9.4-, and 10.2-fold for L35, L36, and L32 respectively, B). However, this is likely
due to elevated OFF expression caused by cognate inducer adenine present
in the cell at 97 μmol/mg DCW. The
highest ON/OFF of 10.3-fold was observed in the D4-addA-L32. The D4-addA
devices were also used to regulate the expression of mKate2 (C). The performance
of these constructs was similar to that observed when regulating eGFP
production, but in this case, the D4-addA-L35 showed the great fold
change performance (ON/UI = 476, ON/OFF = 8.4). The engineered performance
of the D4 expression platform may serve as a useful platform for the
future development of post-transcriptionally regulated riboswitches
through integration of other ligand binding domains. In addition to testing the D4- riboswitch
on a plasmid, the riboswitch construct was also integrated into the
genome of  (C). Similar trends to the D4-ORS were observed
with the consensus RBS greatly increasing ON expression and the D4
anti-RBS leading to restoration of tight UI and OFF expression. The
D4- riboswitch showed riboswitch-dependent control
(ON/OFF, 22-fold) very similar to that of the D4-ORS riboswitch. This
is a drastic improvement compared to the native  riboswitch (ON/OFF = 1.4). Total fold change (ON/UI) was also greatly
increased from 1.2-fold up to 138-fold. To further explore the
context dependency of riboswitch performance
and expand their utility as modular control elements for use in synthetic
biology, we next looked to examine the dependency upon upstream sequence
and promoter. To do so, we initially deleted the LacO sequence of
the promoter (P) immediately downstream of the transcription
start site (TSS) (), reducing the length
of the transcript upstream of the basal aptamer stem by 21 nt (A). The effect of
this reduction in transcript length upstream of the riboswitch was
investigated by designing an alternative upstream linker, restoring
the original length of this upstream region to that of the P system (49 nt). This nucleotide sequence was manually designed to
reduce any predicted interaction with the OFF state riboswitch using
RNAfold. D4-ORS riboswitch constructs
with both the short and long upstream linkers were tested under the
control of 3 constitutive promoters across a range of promoter strengths
(BBa_J23114 = 0.1 a.u, BBa_J23118 = 0.56 a.u, BBa_J23100 = 1 a.u)
using promoters from the Anderson collection (A). Expression analysis with these constructs confirmed that
the D4-ORS
riboswitch functions robustly under constitutive promoter regulation
with riboswitch-dependent control of up to 25-fold observed. We also
observed that the rank order of the Anderson promoters was not impacted
by the insertion of the riboswitches (B). Comparison of the short linker vs the
longer linker revealed that the longer upstream linker consistently
performed better than those with the short linker both in terms of
ON and ON/OFF performance (B). The ON performance of the long linker was 20, 46,
and 66% higher than the short linker constructs for BBa_J23114, BBa_J23118,
and BBa_J23100 promoters, respectively. The effect of modifying the
length of the upstream sequence was further expanded by testing both
the short and long linker variants when place under the control of
the strong P promoter (C). Interestingly, the riboswitch-dependent
control of both short and longer linker D4-ORS constructs showed no
significant difference, and the discrepancy between linker length
was reduced in comparison to that observed when transcription initiation
was regulated by the weaker Anderson promoters. The importance
of the upstream sequence explored here highlights
this as another important factor to consider when incorporating these  post-transcriptional regulation devices into any genetic
control element. Importantly, incorporation of the riboswitches showed
that simply by incorporating 154 nt into the 5′ UTR of a selection
of constitutive promoters, we obtained inducible expression control
units with riboswitch-dependent control of up to 25-fold, demonstrating
the use of the D4-ORS riboswitch to convert constitutive promoters
into small molecule induced expression units across a range of different
promoter strengths. Given that the longer linker gave better or equivalent
ON/OFF performance for the constitutive promoters tested, this linker
was selected for future testing of additional transcriptional and
post-transcriptionally regulated devices. Exploration of the upstream
linker region for these constitutive promoters allowed us to standardize
this transcript region for future engineering. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx Following the
successful integration of the D4-ORS-L35 riboswitch
downstream from a series of constitutive promoters, we looked to integrate
the D4-ORS-L35 into a variety of endogenous environmentally regulated,
stress response promoters. A number of recent studies have developed
stress responsive, transcriptionally regulated devices. While systems which utilize cellular stress to induce transcription
provide a real time response to metabolic stress, the strength of
this response cannot be dynamically regulated. By integrating post-transcriptional
regulation downstream of such promoters, it should be possible to
couple the stress response elements with small molecule induction
and temporal control. Another common mechanism for regulating gene
expression is through the use of bacterial starvation responses. Post-transcriptional
regulation provides an interesting opportunity to advance the use
of systems such as the phosphate starvation promoter, which has been
used in the biological manufacture of therapeutic proteins. In this case, the only way to modify the strength
of the starvation response upon gene expression is to engineer elements
such as the RBS. By integrating such promoters with riboswitch device,
we can modulate the magnitude of gene expression to optimize the production
of the desired protein of interest. By replacing the original promoter
(P) with a number of environmental and metabolic stress
response promoters, namely hyperosmotic stress (P),
phosphate starvation (P), redox stress (P), and carbon starvation (P) responsive promoters
(, ), we constructed tools which are regulated by both
the respective stress response and the riboswitch ligand concentration. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf In A, we
see that the no-riboswitch control (ΔRS) P promoter
is responsive to KHPO over the concentrations
assessed (10 to 0.0001 mM), affording expression output over a 38.6-fold
range. For the P-D4-ORS, we see that the expression
is controlled in response to both varying KHPO and PPDA concentrations (A). The greatest ON is observed at 0.001 mM KHPO and 1000 μM PPDA, while in the absence of PPDA,
we observe tight control of basal expression regardless of the initial
phosphate concentration (gray, ). Riboswitch-dependent control of expression of up to 48-fold
was observed under 1000 μM PPDA and 10 mM KHPO conditions. A maximal PPDA and KHPO dependent dynamic range of the P::D4-ORS-eGFP device
was 646-fold, observed for 1000 μM PPDA and 0.001 mM KHPO with both PPDA and phosphate dependent regulation
of expression (A). This is a significant increase in the dynamic range of this promoter
compared to when no riboswitch is present. Despite the reduction in
maximal ON expression, this enhanced dynamic range is achieved by
drastically reducing the basal “leakiness” of the promoter
under high phosphate conditions. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Similar trends were observed for the P::D4-ORS-eGFP.
This system was induced by both hyperosmotic stress and PPDA (B, ), and GFP fluorescence was measured
after 3 h of hyperosmotic stress and PPDA induction. Tight control
of basal expression, regardless of the NaCl concentration, is afforded
by riboswitch integration (B). The maximal ON expression level was reached at
1 M NaCl and 1000 μM PPDA with riboswitch performance of 7.3-fold
and ON/UI of 36-fold (B, gray ). In comparison, the P ΔRS construct showed
NaCl dependent induction of gene expression with only 4.9-fold control.
The P is also active under stationary phase as well
as being induced by osmotic stress. To investigate whether
the expression of eGFP during stationary phase could be regulated
by the riboswitch, we also measured eGFP expression after 24 h (). At this time point,
we see a loss of osmotic stress dependent expression in the P::D4-ORS strain; in fact, expression is reduced at very
high NaCl concentrations (0.8 and 1 M) in the P ΔRS
construct, likely due to inhibition of cell growth. Despite loss of
NaCl dependent modulation of protein production, riboswitch-dependent
control of expression was maintained with PPDA dependent regulation
up to 15-fold (ON/OFF) after 24 h, showing that the D4-ORS is able
to regulate expression independently of both osmotic stress and stationary
phase dependent effects. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Another stress response transcription
factor dependent promoter
was coupled to the D4-ORS-L35 and assessed for its ability to respond
to peroxide stress. Comparatively, the P::D4-ORS-eGFP
device displayed HO dependent expression after
3 h of expression when induced with a range of HO and PPDA concentrations. At 3 h, expression was altered in
response to increasing both HO (% v/v) and
PPDA concentration (). The ON/UI for the P reached 26.8-fold (0.03% HO, 1000 μM PPDA) (C). P and the soxRS have recently
been used for sensing imbalance of NADP/H redox state, giving the P::D4-ORS-L35 device
great potential in optimizing redox dependent pathways in biotechnology. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf The final stress responsive riboswitch device constructed utilized
the carbon starvation promoter P. This strong stationary
phase promoter is σ70 regulated and glucose repressible. Following
cAMP accumulation, CRP positively regulates P activity,
leading to transcription initiation. Following expression analysis
in LB ± 5% glucose, we observed that the P::ΔRS
is positively regulated in the absence of glucose, which corresponds
to a 4.4-fold increase in eGFP production when cells are cultured
in the absence of glucose. The same trend in observed upon integration
of the D4-ORS; as expected, this device shows riboswitch-dependent
control (D, ). Glucose dependent expression
control in the D4-ORS device reached 7.2-fold (at 200 μM PPDA),
and PPDA addition led to a 9.5-fold increase in protein synthesis.
Combined, the effect of glucose starvation and PPDA induction yielded
an ON/UI of 34.8-fold change in eGFP production (D) on induction with 1000 μM
when induced by carbon starvation. In summary, riboswitch-dependent
control of the output signal from
bacterial stress response promoters proved successful, and  shows that each
promoter was activated by the respective stimuli. By integrating D4-ORS
into these endogenous promoters we have been able to decouple the
signal processing of these cellular stress responses through post-transcriptional
regulation. The introduction of a riboswitch into these promoter elements
converts the simple input-output system into a two-input system, as
both stress response promoter and riboswitch activation (stress +
PPDA) is required to give an output (eGFP expression). In addition
to production applications, these tools could be of
use as sensors in developing understanding of cellular stress responses
and metabolic and environmental stress. Coupling of stress response
promoter with post-transcription, RNA regulated, small molecule inducible
control of expression provides an interesting opportunity. This system
allows cellular detection of a given stress stimuli, meaning that
when this stress exceeds the limits deemed acceptable by the cell
(selective pressure), transcription occurs. However, the riboswitch
will adopt the OFF conformation until user addition of PPDA, allowing
tunable, temporal control over the strength of the cellular stress
response. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Following the end-point characterization of the P::D4-ORS device, we characterized the expression kinetics
of the
device in a mini-fermentation system (BioLector, M2P-Laboratories).
Expression of eGFP for the P riboswitch device was
measured over a 24-h period (E–H; ). Cells were supplemented with different amounts of KHPO4 to allow comparison of eGFP expression in phosphate replete
and depleted conditions. When supplemented with 10 mM KHPO, P is not activated (E); however, at 1 mM KHPO and below, eGFP production is observed, indicating
activation of P (F). Expression begins at ∼2 h, indicating the
onset of the starvation response and plateaus after 4 h, which coincides
with entry into the stationary growth phase (). When grown in 0.1 mM KHPO, this expression onset delay is reduced to ∼30 min (G), and at 0.01 mM
KHPO, expression is observed upon the initial
measurement, suggesting that the cells have entered a starved state
directly following resuspension in media at this concentration of
KHPO. At both of these lower KHPO levels, we see that eGFP production does not plateau
throughout the 24-h measurement period. This is likely due to the
severe phosphate limitation, as indicated by the poor growth of these
cultures. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf At all phosphate concentrations, the basal level of
expression
is tightly repressed (E–H) in the absence of PPDA, and expression is increased
in a PPDA-dependent manner, highlighting the utility of the D4-ORS
to tightly control expression even when transcription has been induced.
To assess the modification of eGFP production rate upon addition of
PPDA, linear regression was carried out during the linear region of
the RFU/OD data sets (2.5–3.5 h). The slope coefficients detailing
the effect of PPDA on the eGFP production rate can be seen in . The fastest production
rate is observed at 1 mM KHPO and 1000 μM
PPDA. After 24 h, the maximal eGFP signal is observed in the 0.1 mM
KHPO culture with 1000 μM PPDA (G). However, when
cells are starved at a phosphate concentration below this (0.01 mM
KHPO), we see a reduction in the maximal fluorescent
signal and rate of expression. This ability to attenuate both the
expression levels and rate of expression further expands the utility
of both stress induced promoter and riboswitches for protein production
applications. Exchanging the ribosome binding site of the
ORS. (A) Overview of
expression platform engineering, showing RBS exchange from the native
RBS (WT_RBS = AGAGAA, red semi-circle) to the  six nucleotide consensus RBS (con_RBS = AGGAGG, green semi-circle),
which was expected to improve protein production. Also shown is the
ORS anti-con_RBS control sequence which contains the modified anti-RBS
sequence. (B) End point measurement of eGFP production following modification
of the RBS in constructs lacking the riboswitch aptamer region (left).
We first tested the native  WT_RBS under transcriptional
regulation from the P promoter in the presence (blue)
and absence (gray) of IPTG (100 μM). Substitution of the native
RBS with a predicted weak/nonfunctional RBS (NF_RBS = TCCTCC) yields
greatly reduced protein expression, confirming correct identification
of the RBS. Subsequently, the AGAGAA motif was exchanged with the
six base consensus sequence (con_RBS = AGGAGG). The right hand side
of this graph shows the performance of the ORS with the native and
consensus RBS sequences and the ORS_con_RBS with a modified anti-RBS
sequence. These constructs were tested in the presence (blue) and
absence (gray) of IPTG (100 μM) plus induction of both transcription
and translation with IPTG (100 μM) and PPDA (1000 μM)
(orange). Anti-RBS library and FACS screening. (A) Design and construction

riboswitch function. The library was grown under OFF (IPTG 100 μM,
blue) and ON (IPTG 100 μM and PPDA 1000 μM, orange) induction
conditions at 30 °C prior to sorting. The lowest 5% of the OFF
population and the upper 5% of the ON population was sorted based
on eGFP fluorescence intensity (green bow). The sorted populations
were recovered and induced under the opposite induction condition,
and the alternate sorting procedure was applied, giving two final
sorting schemes (low > high, high > low). (C) OFF and ON expression

that of the original P construct. The P was then replaced with three different strength promoters from the

induction with PPDA and KHPO, NaCl, HO, or glucose starvation. ΔRS controls included
for comparison. E–H show kinetic microfermentation characterization
of eGFP production (RFU/OD) from the P::D4-ORS-L35
devices when grown in EZ-rich media supplemented with varying levels
of KHPO (E = 10 mM, F = 1 mM, G = 0.1 mM,
H = 0.01 mM) over 24 h. Data represent the mean of three replicates.
Raw data and standard deviations can be seen in . The findings presented
here demonstrate the power of combining
functional selection and multidimensional, multiobjective optimization
for constructing RNA regulators with improved functionality. We show
that through incorporation of both the consensus  RBS and an anti-RBS library that subsequent FACS enrichment and
selection of riboswitches with optimal anti-RBS hairpins can be achieved.
Following further functional optimization through DoE riboswitch,
function of the ORS can be greatly improved (820% improvement in ON
state expression) with PPDA induced riboswitch-dependent control (ON/OFF)
up to 72-fold and overall transcriptional (IPTG) and post-transcriptional
(PPDA) regulation across a 544-fold dynamic range (ON/UI) (D). Design of Experiments
also allowed prediction of factors likely to affect riboswitch robustness
using sparse sampling of a large experimental space to enhance understanding,
probe complex interactions and environmental factors, and guide optimal
construct selection. By improving the function of the PPDA responsive
riboswitch, we built a device comparable with the widely used theophylline
riboswitch, thus expanding the RNA device
toolbox, which will be of great use to the synthetic biology community
and reduce dependence upon protein- and transcription-factor-based
regulation. Unsurprisingly, the SLS regression model predicts
that the stability
of the expression platform hairpin dictates riboswitch function. In
future work, we hope that this framework will allow further prediction
of switches with further enhanced function. Currently, this has proved
challenging due to the complexities of  structural
prediction. A recent review of RNA device design highlights a number
of the challenges in this area. It is
possible that incorporation of more advanced kinetic or three-dimensional
structural predictions into the DoE framework could allow us to build
a predictive model. Additionally, the SLS model built here assumes,
for simplicity, only linear relationships between factors. While this
has proven sufficient for construct selection and robustness testing,
nonlinear modeling may facilitate future further improvement of riboswitch
function. We demonstrate that the riboswitch developed here
functions robustly
in a wide array of contexts, including the regulation of an alternative
gene of interest, when inserted on the genome, and downstream of a
number of different constitutive promoters. In constructing the devices
containing these constitutive transcriptional regulators, we also
highlight the importance of the 5′ UTR, the linker region between
the TSS and the riboswitch structure. The design of these devices
was then used to inform the design of four endogenous  stress response promoter riboswitch regulators. The orthogonal riboswitch
allows translation control of expression from stress responsive promoters
only when PPDA is present. This additional layer of expression control
allows exogenous control of expression following the induction of
transcription by the respective environmental metabolic stress. This
additional layer of riboswitch-dependent control allows for temporal
control and activation of gene expression in response to environmental
and stress stimuli. Decoupling of growth and production phases
has been previously
implemented to maximize volumetric production titers using both process
control strategies such as autoinduction media or late stage fed-batch
induction and autonomous genetic control. However, a challenge with using autonomous control elements such
as promoters responsive to environmental or stress stimulus is their
undesired activation during preculture conditions and prior to induction.
Here, use of a riboswitch permits tight basal control of gene expression
in the absence of riboswitch activation, and upon further activation,
the expression output is attenuated over a large range. This may prove
particularly useful in bioprocessing of toxic or difficult to express
proteins, when it is often desirable to accumulate biomass prior to
protein production while maintaining tight regulation of expression.
This can be challenging in traditional expression systems due to high
basal expression and population-level expression heterogeneity. By
utilizing post-transcriptional control, these issues can be easily
addressed. Additionally, by combining the endogenous sensing capabilities
of the cell with riboswitch control, we addressed a major limitation
to the use of riboswitches. Currently, the numbers of riboswitch–ligand
pairs are somewhat limited, and those which respond to orthogonal
small molecule inducers are limited yet further. By tapping into a
number of endogenous sensory pathways, we expanded the stimuli, which
can regulate protein expression, through post-transcriptional control.
In the case of these systems, promoter activation machinery provides
stimuli specific induction, and the riboswitch affords tunable control.
In other words, once transcription has be activated by the respective
stress stimuli, the magnitude of this activation can be regulated
by riboswitch addition, allowing the expression rate to be balanced
with respect to the cellular capacity to produce, process, or secrete
the desired protein of interest. The
combination of stress activated transcription and tunable control
of protein production will hopefully prove of great use to the synthetic
biology and bioprocessing communities. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Supporting Information and Methods http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_002.xlsx All cloning, including library
generation, was carried out using HiFi assembly (NEB #E5520S) and
transformation into  DH5 alpha (NEB

DNA was then isolated using silica column purification (Qiagen) and
transformed into chemically competent  DH10β

all subsequent expression analyses, unless stated otherwise. pKIKO
vectors were cloned in  PIR2 strain (Invitrogen).

Conditions Single colonies
were inoculated into LB medium and carbenicillin 100 μg mL (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1.0% bactotryptone)
following calcium chloride mediated transformation of plasmid DNA
into chemically competent cells prepared according to a modified procedure. Liquid cultures were incubated at 37 °C
with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h overnight. These seed cultures were
diluted 100× in 10 mL of LB supplemented with 0.2% glucose and
incubated as before for 2 h (OD 600–0.3). Cultures were then
aliquoted (500 μL) into deep well plates (Amgen 1.4 mL 96 well
plates) with the designated final inducer concentrations (100 μM
IPTG) and pyrimido-[4,5-]-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine
(PPDA) or 2-amino- purine (2-AP) at 1000 μM for standard OFF–ON
expression. All constitutive promoter constructs were induced with
PPDA only, i.e. no IPTG was required. Following incubation for 3 h,
250 μL of culture was aspirated into a separate deep well block,
and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were then
washed with PBS (Sigma), diluted 1:4, and the cell density and fluorescence
were recorded using a ClarioStar microplate reader (BMG). EZ-rich
media (Teknova) was used for testing and kinetic characterization
of the PphoA::D4-ORS-L35 device. EZ-rich is a modified Neidhardt media with the following composition: 40 mM MOPS,
4 mM tricine, 0.01 mM iron sulfate, 9.5 mM ammonium chloride, 0.276
mM potassium sulfate, 0.0005 mM calcium chloride, 0.525 mM magnesium

0.01 mM dihydroxyl benzoic acid, and 0.2% glucose (w/v). FACS Counter-Selection
of Improved Riboswitch Variants Two separate sorting schemes
were applied to isolate functional riboswitches
from the anti-RBS library; sorting of cells with low fluorescence
intensity under OFF induction, followed by sorting of highly fluorescent
cells under ON induction (low > high). Conversely, the opposite
scheme
was also applied, where highly fluorescent cells were sorted under
ON induction, followed by isolation of cells with low fluorescence
when induced with OFF. Prior to FACS sorting, 500 μL of the
cryopreserved library was inoculated into 50 mL of LB + carbenicillin
100 μg mL and incubated for 16 h at 30 °C
with shaking at 200 rpm. The culture was diluted 100× and incubated
as before for 2.5 h (OD600 = 0.3). Cells were then induced with either
100 μM IPTG or 100 μM IPTG + 200 μM PPDA and incubated
for 20 h at 30 °C, and cells (2 mL) were then harvested by centrifugation
and resuspended in PBS prior to FACS sorting. The bottom 5% of the
IPTG induced culture (low OFF expression) and the top 5% of the IPTG
+ PPDA (high on expression) were sorted (10 000 events). Following
sorting of these two populations, 15 mL of LB + 0.2% glucose was added
to the sort tubes. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (2500 for 10 min), resuspended in 1 mL of LB + 0.2% glucose,
and incubated overnight at 30 °C, 200 rpm. The induction and
sorting process was repeated as before, but each population was induced
under the alternative condition (IPTG only > IPTG + PPDA, IPTG
+ PPDA
> IPTG only). Sorted cells were resuspended and concentrated as
before
and plated onto LB + carbenicillin 100 μg mL + 0.2% glucose plates. All FACS analysis was carried out using a
Sony SH800. Data were analyzed using FlowJo Single Cell Analysis Software
version 10. Single
colonies (90
from each FACS sort scheme) were inoculated into 500 μL of LB
+ carbenicillin 100 μg mL + 0.2% glucose
and incubated at 37 °C shaking at 1000 rpm for 16 h. This culture
was then diluted 100× in LB + carbenicillin 100 μg mL + 0.2% glucose in a 96 deep well block prior to incubation
for 2 h at 37 °C shaking at 1000 rpm. The culture was then induced
with 100 μM of IPTG. Half of the IPTG induced culture was then
transferred to another plate and induced with 1000 μM of PPDA.
Both plates were incubated for a further 3 h. The resulting culture
was harvested by centrifugation at 2250 for 10 min
at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and pelleted
by centrifugation as before. Finally, cells were again resuspended
and diluted 1:1 in PBS. A 200 μL aliquot was then transferred
into a black, clear flat-bottomed microplate (Greiner), and the optical
density (OD λ = 600 nm) and fluorescence (eGFP fluorescence
was measured at λEx/λEm = 488/520 nm, while mKate2 fluorescence
was measured at λEx/λEm = 588/633 nm) were recorded. Fluorescence
was then normalized to optical density (RFU/OD). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf The Design of Experiment data
structure was generated with JMP 12 pro using the custom design tool.
D-optimality was used to select the chosen design from a number of
randomly generated designs (random starts = 20 000) to investigate
all main effects and two-factor interactions. The factors tested by
the D-optimal Design of Experiments are listed in . This design was generated using JMP-12
Pro Custom Design tool based on the D-optimality criteria which scores
designs based on reducing the generalized variance around the selected
design points, thus giving a more precise estimate of the model effects.
The design is a modified fractional factorial design consisting of
40 runs containing 4 center points. The choice of runs was determined
by the JMP custom design algorithm. Modeling of the structured experimental
data set will allow the prediction of all linear main effects and
two-factor interactions. Unlike other fractional factorial DoE designs,
the D-optimal custom design allows fractional reduction in the number
of experiments required while also facilitating testing of multiple
categorical factors (i.e., A or B or C) at more than two levels, making
its use essential for DoE testing of the 4 N-terminal linker variants
used in this study. An eight-run block was included to control for
run order effects and to protect against user error. If human error
prevented the use of any data points, this block would mean that only
the runs in the respective block need be repeated. Confirmation that
this repeated data did not significantly deviate from the rest of
the data set is then confirmed when assessing the model effects during
SLS regression. SLS model fitting did not assign the block effect
as significant. The induction protocol was modified to align with
the data structure shown in . Data were collected and processed using the expression conditions
described previously. Protein expression was measured after 3 and
24 h. The SLS model fitting and all subsequent experimental expression
data (D–F)
show the eGFP production after 24 h. Standard Least Squares
Model Fitting http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00017/suppl_file/sb9b00017_si_001.pdf Modeling was carried
out using the Fit Model function with JMP pro 12. The statistical
model was built using the JMP 12 pro Standard Least Squares fit model
algorithm using Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) reduction. Factor importance
and factor effects were assessed using ANOVA. The underlying SLS model
is represented in this study using the JMP 12 pro Prediction Profiler

were then diluted 100× in EZ-rich media and grown to an optical
density (λ = 600 nm) of 0.3 (∼2.5 h). The culture was
centrifuged (2250, 5 min) and resuspended in an
equal volume of EZ-rich media supplemented with either 10, 1.32, 1,
0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or 0.0001 mM KHPO. The culture

°C with shaking at 1000 rpm for 24 h. The OD600 and fluorescence
was measured at 24 h. Cells were washed in PBS, and readings were
taken as described previously, carried out in biological triplicate. Expression kinetics of the P::D4-ORS-L35 was also
assessed. Cells were treated as above, but following resuspension
in KHPO supplemented media, the cell suspension
was transferred (1 mL) into a 48 well, baffled deep-well plate (m2p,
M2P-48-B) containing either 1000, 400, 200, 40, 8, and 1.6 μM

100 μg mL and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C
with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were then diluted 100× in LB-rich
media and grown to an optical density (λ = 600 nm) of 0.3. The
culture was centrifuged (2250 g, 5 min) and resuspended in an equal
volume of LB media supplemented with 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, or 0.171
M (standard LB) or 0.1 M NaCl. The culture was then aliquoted (500
μL) into a 96-well deep-well block and induced with 0, 40, 200,
and 1000 μM PPDA and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at
1000 rpm for 24 h. The OD600 and fluorescence was measured at 3 and
24 h. Cells were washed in PBS, and readings were taken as described
previously. This experiment was carried out in biological triplicate. Hydrogen Peroxide Induction of P Assay The

culture was then aliquoted (500 μL) into a 96-well deep-well
block and induced with hydrogen peroxide (0, 0.3, 0.03, 0.003, and
0.0003%) and PPDA (0, 40, 200, and 1000 μM) and incubated at
37 °C with shaking at 1000 rpm for 24 h. The OD600 and fluorescence
was measured at 3 and 24 h as previously described. The assay was
carried out in biological triplicate. The PD4-ORS-L35-eGFP and P ΔRS-L35-eGFP constructs
were transformed into  DH10β TOP10 F′.
