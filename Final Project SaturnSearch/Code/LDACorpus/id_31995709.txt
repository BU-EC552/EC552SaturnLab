Synthetic
biology is a rapidly
developing field providing a wide variety of options for construction
of biomolecular computers  and  with numerous applications in nanotechnology. Diverse systems have been developed employing mostly DNA, but also RNA, or enzymes to execute logic computing tasks using biomolecule-based Boolean
logic gates. While a majority of the work has been done at the DNA
or protein level, the engagement of lipid membranes and membrane proteins
has been very limited in molecular-scale computational elements due to particular structural features of membrane proteins and the
complex nature of the lipid bilayer membrane. Protein logic gates consist of an input component, which is
sensitive
to specific input signal, and an output component, which upon transduction
of the incoming signal produces the perceivable effect. Engineering principles are very diverse as protein
logic functions can be achieved with either single domain proteins,
where the same domain has the input and the output capability, or
by fusing two domains where one domain functions as a recognition
domain (the input domain) and the other as an effector (the output
domain). Proteins with a natural ability
to form defined pores in membranes, so-called pore-forming proteins
or pore-forming toxins (PFTs), offer an excellent option for logic
gate design on membranes. These protein molecules are soluble as monomeric
units, capable of binding to lipid membranes in a lipid-specific manner
and consequently form oligomeric transmembrane pores, which are well-defined
in terms of shape and size. Pore-formation is a
complex process and is composed of succession of steps that can be
manipulated in order to control the pore opening. Several applications of PFTs have been developed, , for release of compounds encapsulated in lipid vesicles-based delivery
systems, biosensing, and as integral parts of artificial cells. However, all those systems lack
self-regulatory modules or produce only small (around 2 nm in diameter)
membrane pores. To bypass limitations of existing protein-vesicle
systems, we present
a unique multilevel system where we combined synthetic biology with
the rational design and directed evolution based on a PFT listeriolysin
O (LLO). This protein toxin is a major virulence factor of bacteria . It belongs to a protein family of
cholesterol-dependent cytolysins that are able to form large pores
on membranes of target cells, exceeding 20 nm in diameter. LLO is composed of four domains (a), each playing a particular role in the pore-forming process. LLO
predominately forms arc-shaped pores on the surface of target cells in a succession of steps, which involve binding to lipid bilayers
with high cholesterol content by using domain 4 (D4; a), oligomerization on the
membrane surface, and final pore formation in which two β-hairpins
are formed from two clusters of α-helices in domain 3 (D3) of
each monomer (b). We have recently reported an interesting mutant of LLO, Y406A
(a), which
shows a unique pH-regulated pore-forming activity. While it binds
to cholesterol-rich membranes in a wide pH range, it is able to form
pores and is thus fully active only at low pH values. We created a logic gate on lipid membrane by combining Y406A with
an additional inhibitor of its activity, a designed ankyrin repeat
protein (DARPin) variant 22, D22, which binds reversibly to Y406A.
In the  state of the logic gate, Y406A is doubly
inhibited by D22 covalently bound to the membrane, and pH > 7.4.
The
logical functioning of the protein gate was achieved with various
cleavages of D22 from the membrane and pH activation of Y406A. Upon
system activation, the inhibiting D22 dissociates from Y406A, which
then, at a favorable pH, undergoes conformational changes and forms
pores in membranes. Properties and permeabilizing activity of Y406A. (a) A ribbon model

bars), DARPin clones that were selected with ribosome display as high
affinity binders, but did not inhibit hemolytic activity of Y406A.
Mean ± SD;  = 2–7. DARPin D22 Binds Specifically
to Y406A in Solution and in the
Membrane-Bound State Y406A is an interesting pH-dependent
LLO mutant, which has a very narrow activity profile of pH dependence.
It is active at low pH values, drastically loses activity in the pH
range 6.0–7.4, and is not active at pH values >7.4 (c). However, it is
still capable of binding to the membrane at high pH values. Y406A is thus perfectly suited for controlled
release in liposomal applications employing pH as an input signal.
In order to provide another level of control over Y406A permeabilizing
activity, we have developed a DARPin-based inhibitor. DARPins represent
a useful tool for specific targeting of bigger molecules, such as
proteins, due to their large interaction surface and high binding
capacity. Specific DARPin inhibitor of permeabilizing activity of
Y406A was gained with ribosome display. Forty clones
among enriched variants after six rounds of ribosome display were
isolated and tested with ELISA. Three clones, D6, D22, and D30 that
exhibited highest affinity toward immobilized target protein were
further selected and checked for permeabilizing activity. D22 was
selected for further studies, because of its specific inhibition of
hemolytic activity of Y406A, but not of the wild-type LLO (d). To further prove
the specificity of D22 for Y406A, inhibitory effect of D22 was tested
toward another member of cholesterol-dependent cytolysin and a homologue
of LLO, Perfringolysin O (PFO) from bacterium , and its mutant Y381A, which is analogous to
Y406A (d). Indeed, D22 is selective only for Y406A
by exhibiting no significant effect on hemolytic activity of these
two homologous proteins (d). The size exclusion chromatography proved
stable complex formation between Y406A and D22 (a). Isothermal titration calorimetry suggested
a stoichiometry ratio of Y406A-D22 complex to be 1 (0.96 ± 0.15)
(b), with a
binding constant  of 114 ± 43 nM
( > 4; average ± SD). LLO did not show any
detectable binding at the same conditions (b). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements
confirmed formation of Y406A-D22 complex (c), indicating that D22 is most likely associated
with the domain 2 (D2) of Y406A (c inset). In the next step we wanted to test whether D22 interferes
with
the binding of Y406A to the lipid membrane. LLO and Y406A require
high concentrations of lipid receptor cholesterol in membranes, and we used a mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl--glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):cholesterol 3:2 (mol:mol) in all
model lipid vesicles systems presented in this paper, unless stated
otherwise. Preincubated mixture of Y406A and D22 in solution showed
larger surface plasmon resonance (SPR) response than Y406A alone,
which indicates that Y406A-D22 complex can indeed bind to the membrane
(a). This is
in agreement with proposed mode of binding of D22 to Y406A  D2 (c), which leaves D4 free for interaction with the lipid membrane.
D22 itself did not bind to the lipid membrane (a). D22 also bound to the membrane-bound
Y406A and the interaction was reversible, with slow dissociation of
D22. As expected, D22 did not bind to the membrane-bound LLO (b). This was also
independently confirmed by vesicle sedimentation assays (c and d). Thus,
D22 specifically binds to soluble as well as membrane-bound Y406A. Binding of D22 to Y406A in solution. (a)

Permeabilizing Activity We next verified ability of D22 to
provide additional control of
Y406A permeabilizing activity in different functional assays. For
this purpose, we assayed permeability of giant unilamellar vesicles
(GUVs) for fluorescently labeled dextran of 10 kDa size (FD10) and
a Stokes radius of 23.6 Å at two pH values, 6.5 and 8.0. LLO
was able to permeabilize GUVs at either pH and was not affected by
D22 (a). Y406A
clearly showed activity only at low pH and in the absence of D22,
while in the presence of D22, the permeabilizing activity of Y406A
was inhibited (b). We also assayed hemolytic activity of LLO or Y406A at two pH
values, pH 5.7 and 7.4, and in the presence or absence of D22. Hemolysis
results confirmed the results obtained in the GUVs system (c and d). D22 itself
was not able to induce any damage to the GUV lipid membrane at either
pH (e) and
was not hemolytic up to 9.5 μM concentration (data not shown),
which is in agreement with SPR results that showed a lack of membrane
association for D22 (). The experiments presented in  convincingly show that activity of Y406A
can be controlled by pH as expected, as
well as with D22, which provides an additional level of control over
Y406A activity. This system can thus conceptually be described as
the NOR logic gate, when activity (pore formation) is observed only
in the absence of the two signals, D22 and pH > 7.4 (f). We further demonstrated the principle of selective inhibition of
Y406A permeabilizing activity by assaying release of encapsulated
fluorescent probe calcein from small and large unilamellar vesicles
(SUVs and LUVs, respectively). In a SUVs system we essentially obtained
similar results as in the GUVs system, with LLO showing similar activity
regardless the condition at which it was assayed (a), while Y406A only showed
activity at pH 6.5 in the absence of D22 (b). Y406A showed negligible release of calcein
also in a LUVs system when assayed at high pH (8.0) (c, traces A and D). Membrane-bound
Y406A can be effectively activated by addition of small quantity of
HCl (c, blue
trace D, pH drop to approximately 6.5) in agreement with previous
work. D22 provided an effective control
over Y406A permeabilizing activity also in this system. The pH activation
of Y406A did not occur when D22 was added to solution containing vesicles
and Y406A (c, trace A), when Y406A was preincubated with D22 before addition
to vesicles (c, trace B) or when Y406A was added to vesicles and D22 in an acidic
environment subsequently (c, trace C). Interestingly, addition of D22 after activation
of Y406A also inhibited further release of calcein, showing that D22
is efficient modulator that rapidly affects permeabilizing activity
of Y406A (c,
trace E). In summary, permeabilizing experiments employing four independent
model systems thus clearly exemplify a two-level control system of
Y406A activity, modulated by the change in pH and the presence of
D22. Modulation of Y406A permeabilization

Covalently Bound D22 Allows
Employment of Various Signals for Activation of Y406A We
showed that D22 does not associate with lipid membrane by itself () and does not damage
the lipid membrane ( and ), which is a convenient feature
for development of logic gates, since it could be attached to the
lipid bilayer without damaging or changing its properties. In order
to bind D22 to lipid membranes, we prepared a variant of D22 by adding
the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) cleavable peptide and an additional
cysteine to the C-terminal end (D22M). This change in amino acid sequence
did not affect inhibitory potential of D22M toward Y406A (d). Such construct
allowed attachment of D22 to the lipid membrane by conjugation  the introduced cysteine residue at the C-terminus and
offered removal of D22 from the membrane surface by either proteolytic
cleavage or addition of a reductant. Two alternative conjugations
of D22M to lipid bilayers were thus prepared by using different functionalized
lipids. In the case of 1,2-distearoyl--glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine--[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000Mal),
D22 was attached to the lipid  stable irreversible
thioether linkage and the subsequent release of D22 was achieved using
MMP-9 cleavage (a). In the case of 1,2-distearoyl--glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[PDP(polyethylene
glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000PDP), D22M was attached to the lipid  reversible S–S bond and the subsequent release
of D22 was achieved upon addition of a reducing agent such as Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP) (c). Both lipids contain a PEG linker, which provides flexibility
of membrane-anchored D22M needed for efficient inhibition of membrane-bound
Y406A. We optimized assays by (i) selecting the appropriate variant
of
D22 (N- terminal or C-terminal modification) and functionalized lipids
(we tested lipids with or without flexible PEG linker) and (ii) determining
the minimal proportion of functionalized lipids to show efficient
inhibition of Y406A and cleavage of conjugated D22M from the MLVs
by either MMP-9 or TCEP. We tested a range of Y406A (200 nM to 2 μM),
conjugated lipids (from 2 to 10 mol %), TCEP (10 to 30 mM) and MMP-9
(0.002 μg, 0.02 μg and 0.1 μg) concentrations. We
observed that the most optimal concentrations were the following,
500 nM Y406A, 2 mol % of conjugated lipids, 10 mM TCEP or 0.1 μg
of MMP-9. When we used higher concentration of conjugated lipid, we
needed more Y406A for efficient permeabilization, but also more TCEP
or MMP-9, which we tried to avoid because of background effects of
buffers in which these substances are stored and unwanted cleavage
of proteins by MMP-9 (see below). After D22M conjugation, stability
of D22M attachment to MLVs and cleavage from vesicles by different
agents was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis (). D22M was in both cases attached to the
surface of vesicles and was successfully released from them after
addition of either MMP-9 (b) or TCEP (e). We also checked whether membrane-conjugated D22M
could be released from the membrane upon incubation of D22M-conjugated
vesicles with Y406A. Indeed, the majority of the D22M was released
from the vesicle membrane upon MMP-9 or TCEP cleavage with only minor
amounts of D22M visible on the SDS-PAGE gels in the pellet fraction
(c and f),
which might be due to the fact that not all of the D22M dissociated
from Y406A despite the fact it was cleaved from the vesicles. On the
other hand Y406A was not affected by such treatments and remained
stably associated with the lipid membrane (c and f), apart from minor degradation of
Y406A in the pelleted fraction in the presence of MMP-9 (c), which, however,
did not have a great effect on Y406A’s ability to form pores
(see below). Conjugation of D22M to vesicles and cleavage with different agents.

Y406A and D22M Conjugation of D22M to the lipid membrane
of vesicles allowed development
of a controllable system with different logic gates (a). We followed calcein release
from the vesicles to prove the gate opening (, pore formation) of different systems. To develop an AND gate, D22M
was attached by maleimide conjugation using DSPE-PEG2000Mal, and calcein
was released from MLVs only upon both low pH and MMP-9 cleavage (b). In the second
system, an OR-AND gate could be conceptualized (c). Employment of DSPE-PEG2000PDP was used
to attach D22M to the vesicles, and the release of D22M from the vesicles
was achieved by either the reducing agent or MMP-9, whereas system
activation was achieved when one or both of those signals were present
in addition to low pH in the surrounding buffer solution. This experiment
was performed in microplate wells with ordered addition of different
reagents and no possibility for washing away the components present
in the reaction mixture. However, robust and significant differences
between the closed () and the opened () states were found in both cases (). A tunable vesicle system. (a) Y406A activity
is controlled by pH
and the reversible inhibitor D22. Vesicles are at pH 8.0; therefore,
two input signals are needed for system activation: lowering pH with
HCl and elimination of D22 from the system by release from vesicles
induced by MMP-9 or TCEP. (b) A system based on DSPE-PEG2000Mal lipid.

protein logic gates are generally operated  proteolytic
cleavage or allosteric regulation of conformationally
stable proteins. Complex protein structures, enabling multidomain
gating, are implemented in order to obtain higher efficiency of the
system. However, a majority of the work on protein logic gates is done with
enzymes in solution. A valuable contribution to synthetic biology
represent PFTs, which are an excellent
system since they are well characterized at the structural level,
form stable pore complexes that are hard to dissociate once assembled,
operate at the level of lipid membranes, and are amenable for rational
design and mutagenesis to yield variants with changed useful properties.
The incorporation of a stimuli-sensing PFT into lipid vesicles could
thus enable a controlled opening of the membrane and consequently
release of the encapsulated content at the desired site. In
this work we used a mutant of the PFT LLO, Y406A, to design
protein logic gate at the surface of lipid membranes. Y406A is perfectly
suited for such applications, since it forms transmembrane homo-oligomeric
pores from soluble monomeric units in a controllable stepwise mechanism.
We have shown before that single amino
acid mutation in LLO D2, Y406A, drastically alters protein characteristics,
most significantly its pH-dependent behavior, whereas the size of
the formed pores remains generally the same. Here we employed a small
protein molecule D22, which specifically and reversibly inhibits activity
of Y406A by binding to the domain D2. The complex Y406A-D22 can still
bind to lipid membranes (); however, Y406A in such complex is not able to form
pores. Our results suggest that D22 binds to the D2 of Y406A, which
might prevent conformational changes in Y406A needed in the final
stages of pore formation. An additional
advantage of LLO-based systems is that LLO forms large pores with
diameter of 25–40 nm in lipid membranes. This feature makes
it extraordinary for synthetic biology and could be used for example
in liposome-based delivery systems of larger proteins. In comparison
to small pores of approximately 1.5–2 nm in diameter that are
formed by some toxins, such as α-toxin from () and aerolysin-like proteins
such as lysenin, Y406A can make much
larger pores enabling release of larger compounds, such as 10 kDa
dextran shown in , or even larger 70 kDa dextran (∼12 nm in diameter). Y406A-D22 system could thus be used for liposome-based
delivery of small proteins, such as nanobodies, or small enzymes. We developed protein logic functioning for precise activation and
release of lipid vesicles-encapsulated cargo. Our robust system consists
of a vesicle with membrane-conjugated D22 that binds and reversibly
inhibits Y406A. The system can be activated upon two different and
very specific signals (low pH in conjunction with reductive environment
or MMP-9), and therefore opens the vesicle in regulated manner and
release the vesicle-encapsulated cargo. The nature of the system follows
the “all-or-nothing” principle, where the response is
fully expressed once activated. Two-level complex gates, especially
with the possibility of different activating inputs that do not cancel
each other out, function much better due to higher efficiency and
simplicity compared to the sum of the individual gates. The modularity
makes the logical functioning of this system suitable for diverse
applications because of distinct operations being executed by separate
components and the ease of expansion of input signals by incorporation
of recognition sites for other proteolytic enzymes at the C-terminus
of D22, or integration of other cleavable linkers, responsive to various
reagents (reducing, oxidizing, nucleophilic/basic, electrophilic/acidic),
metals, lysosomal enzymes, light, . Further development of logic gate system is also possible with utilization
of other LLO variants. LLO undergoes extensive conformational rearrangements
during pore formation, for example two clusters of helices in D3 rearrange
and form two β-hairpins that are inserted in lipid membrane
and form the β-barrel of the final pore (b). Introduction of two cysteine residues
in one of the helix clusters, A318C-L334C, prevents these rearrangements
and pore formation upon disulfide formation. Such LLO variants could help to achieve additional logic operations
using reductants as one of the input signals. The presented
system has a high potential to be used for therapeutic
purposes, as it enables vesicle packing for directed administration
of small molecules, biologics, or other protein or nonprotein cargos
of high molecular weight, enabling very precise regulation and reliable
delivery. The provided system has a potential in cancer treatment,
where especially the differences in pH, redox potential, and presence of metalloproteinases between normal and cancerous tissue are significant and could provide input signals for the Y406A-D22
system. The plasmid pRDV was kindly

unless stated otherwise. D22 Design and Ribosome Display The inhibitor that
potently, specifically and selectively binds to Y406A, D22, was developed  directed evolution approach by using a randomized gene
library of human ankyrin repeat consensus sequence. It contains 2 capping and 3 modular ankyrin repeats, each
repeat forming a β-sheet followed by two α-helices. We
applied diversity to the elements of secondary structure by randomizing
20 amino acid residues per each of 3 internal modular repeats: on
the β-sheet and on the first α-helix. The resulting DARPin
naïve library was cloned into pRDV vector and subjected to
6 rounds of ribosome display selection technique, following the protocol
of Dreier and Plückthun, with
LLO directly immobilized on plastic surface as a target (concentration
decreasing from 200 nM at first round to 20 nM to sixth round of selection).
Selection pressure was performed with the following washing steps:
5 short washes at the first round, gradually enhancing to 5 ×
short, 2 × 20 min, 40 min, 1 short wash at the sixth round. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of LLO, Y406A, D22, and
D22M Genes for the wild-type LLO, Y406A, or D22 were multiplied
by PCR, cleaved and inserted into a precleaved pProEXHTb expression
vector. DARPin 22M (D22M) was created by substituting Cys50 and Cys167
to Ser (to avoid unspecific conjugation) and extending the protein
at the C-terminal end with MMP-9 cleavage site sequence GPLGMLSQ, followed by the GGGSGGGS linker and the final
residue Cys (for specific conjugation to the lipids). The gene for
D22M was inserted into the precleaved pET28a expression vector. All
constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Expression of genes
was performed in  BL21 (DE3) pLysS
strain (Novagen, United States) in terrific broth (TB) supplemented
with ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking until
optical density at 600 nm reached ∼1. The expression of desired
genes was then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (final concentration). Cells
were grown for additional 5 h at 37 °C (D22) or 20 h at 20 °C,
respectively (LLO and Y406A), centrifuged for 10 min at 2800 at 4 °C and frozen to −20 °C. Buffer
containing 50 mM Na-phosphate, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol
and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at pH 6.5 was added
to thawed lysate, which was then sonicated and centrifuged for 1 h
at 35 000 at 4 °C. Supernatants were
filtered through 0.45 and 0.22 μm filters. Filtrates were purified
by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), using a 9.6-ml
Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Germany), coupled to the Åkta FPLC system
(Amersham Biosciences, United Kingdom). Column was equilibrated with
buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 following
the application of lysate and washing of unbound proteins with buffer
containing 10 mM and 60 mM of imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted
by imidazole in the buffer (500 mM for D22 and D22M, and 300 mM for
LLO wt and Y406A). His-tags were than cleaved off (0.6 mg Tobacco
Etch Virus (TEV) protease to 1 mL of the sample) during overnight
dialysis at 4 °C against 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl at pH 7.4.
Flow-through after additional IMAC, containing purified protein, was
concentrated and buffer changed to 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.7
using Amicon Ultra 10 kDa MWCO (Merck, Germany). Content, size and
purity of samples were observed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing
desired proteins were pooled, concentration determined spectrophotometrically
(Agilent 8453 UV–visible Spectroscopy System, United States),
aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) 100 nM LLO
was immobilized on Nunc Maxi-Sorp 96-well microtiter plate (Thermo
Fisher, United States) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed after
that three times with TBST buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05%
Tween-20 (Merck Millipore, United States), pH 7.4). After that, wells
were blocked with buffer containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h and washed three
times with TBST. Sample proteins (40 different clones of 5 μM
DARPins with hexahistidine tags, isolated after six rounds of ribosome
display) were added to wells and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature
with gentle shaking. After that, wells were washed 3 times with TBST
and subsequently 1.6 nM mouse monoclonal anti-6His IgG antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, United States) were added and incubated
in wells for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Wells
were washed four times with TBST and 10 000 × diluted
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich,
United States) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with gentle shaking. Wells were washed four times with TBST. 150 μL
of the substrate system for ELISA detection TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine)/HO (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) was added per
each well and incubated for 30 min in dark at room temperature. To
stop the reaction, 75 μL of TMB substrate for ELISA (Stop solution,
Sigma-Aldrich, United States) was added and absorbance was measured
immediately with microplate reader Synergy MX (Biotek, United States)
at 450 nm and at 600 nm for background subtraction. Size Exclusion
Chromatography (SEC) Size exclusion
chromatography was performed on UPLC Acquity Waters system (Waters
Corporation, United States) with Acquity UPLC BEH200 1.7 μm
column. The running buffer composition was 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, pH 7.4. Samples were injected at 0.4 mL/min flow rate at the
concentration of single proteins being 26.6 μM; complexes were
mixed at 1:1 molar ratio and preincubated for 30 min at room temperature
before the injection. The protein elution profile was monitored with
a UV-detector operated at 280 nm. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
(ITC) ITC experiments
were conducted using a VP-ITC (MicroCal, United States). All protein
samples for ITC measurements contained 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. 38
injections of 8 μL (first 2 injections 2 μL) of D22 were
added by using a computer-controlled microsyringe at intervals of
300 s into the solution of LLO, Y406A, or buffer under constant stirring
(307 rpm) at 25 °C. Reference power was set to 10 μcal/s
and initial delay before injections was 180 s. The concentrations
used for the experiments were 5.9 μM for LLO and Y406A, and
54.9 μM for D22 (the concentration in the syringe). Titrations
were carried out in the buffer containing 22 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl and
5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, at pH 5.7. Buffer was the same for all components
to cancel out the possibility of the buffer background signal. Binding
parameters were calculated by integration of individual titration
peaks and presenting the resulting binding isotherm in a Wiseman plot.
Isotherm was fitted to a model for one set of sites, which works for
one site or n identical sites, binding constant () and enthalpy (Δ). We calculated stoichiometry
(), Δ and  for each data set using the one-site reaction model in the Origin
7 ITC software package (MicroCal, USA). Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
(SAXS) Data Collection,  Shape Determination
and Molecular Modeling Y406A and D22 were mixed in a 1:1
molar ratio and stored at −70
°C. Buffer composition was 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT,
pH 5.7. After thawing, the sample was centrifuged and serial dilution
from 164 μM to 5.5 μM was prepared. SAXS measurements
were performed at the high brilliance synchrotron beamline P12 at
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL, DESY, Hamburg). The
X-ray wavelength was λ = 1.24 Å. Detector (Pilatus 2M)
to sample distance was 3 m, resulting in a  range
of 0.003–0.5 Å. Measurements were
performed at 23 °C, samples storage temperature before the measurement
was 10 °C. Exposure time was 45 ms and 20 frames were recorded
in one second with constant flow through the quartz capillary. The
flow ensures that a certain sample volume is illuminated only for
a certain time and is displaced by the fresh sample volume. On the
basis of the comparison of successive frames, no detectable radiation
damage was observed. Frames were normalized to the transmitted beam
intensity, azimuthally integrated and averaged, resulting in scattering
curves () . The background from the quartz capillary and
sample buffer was subtracted. These averaged and subtracted difference
curves were next normalized by their concentrations. Low quality data
and very low and very high  values were discarded.
Valid  range was between 0.006 and 0.48 Å. Two approaches to data analysis were tested. First,
concentrations from 37.5 μM to 5.5 μM were used to extrapolate
data and in parallel concentrations of 73 μM (high-s) and 9.7
μM (low-s) were merged for modeling. We saw no major differences
between extrapolated data and merged data and we report data from
the merged data set. All data manipulations were performed with PRIMUS,
part of ATSAS software suite. Low-resolution
shape envelopes were determined using the  bead modeling program DAMMIF as part
of the ATSAS online software suite. The results of 20 independent
DAMMIF runs were clustered and analyzed online using DAMAVER to identify the most representative models.
Rigid body molecular modeling was conducted using  mutated crystal structures of Y406A and D22. LLO (PDB ID: 4CDB()) residue Tyr406 was mutated to Ala using Pymol. First 19 residues of LLO were absent in the
crystal structure and were modeled using Modeler software to neutralize the difference between the measured
and modeled Y406A. D22 was modeled with SWISS-MODEL and model PDB ID: 2P2C() was used as the template.
Rigid body modeling was conducted in ATSAS online service using the
program SASREF. Merged data set and two
subunits were inserted and modeled without any symmetry. Models were
aligned in Pymol with SASpy plugin (supalm). POPC and cholesterol were
dissolved in chloroform and mixed together in a molar ratio 3:2 or
1:1. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator
(Büchi, Switzerland) and the resulting lipid film on glass
flask wall was left to dry for additional 4 h in a vacuum (SpeedVac,
Thermo Scientific, United States). The film was then resuspended in
the buffer (20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.7, or 20 mM Tris, 150 mM
NaCl, pH 7.4) by alternatingly vortexing and heating (65 °C,
water bath) the sample for 10–15 min. To get multilamellar
vesicles (MLVs), this sample was additionally freeze–thawed
in liquid N for 6 times. To obtain SUVs, MLVs were pulse-sonicated
on ice using a Cole Parmer CPX500 500 W sonicator for 15 min (10 s
on/10 s off duty cycle) at 38% amplitude. MLVs were extruded through
100 nm pore size polycarbonate membranes by the mini extruder (Avanti
Polar Lipids, United States) to yield large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs)
of 100 nm in diameter. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were prepared
by electroformation method, as described previously by Ruan () Shortly, lipid mixture
POPC:Chol 3:2 (mol:mol) with addition of 1 mol % rhodamine-DHPE was
placed on ITO-slides and dried under the nitrogen stream. Electroformation
was carried out between two conductive ITO-slides (Vesicle Prep Pro,
Nanion Technologies, Germany) in sucrose solution (300 mM sucrose,
1 mM MES, pH 6.5, or 300 mM sucrose, 1 mM Tris, pH 8.0) for 4 h with
3 V amplitude and 5 Hz frequency. Afterward, GUVs were sedimented
with glucose solution (300 mM glucose, 1 mM MES, pH 6.5, or 300 mM
glucose, 1 mM Tris, pH 8.0) and addition of buffer (10 mM MES, 150
mM NaCl, pH 6.5, or 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). The osmolarity
of all solutions was adjusted with Osmomat 3000 (Gonotec GmbH, Germany). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) SPR measurements were
performed on a Biacore X100 (GE Healthcare, Biacore AB, Sweden) at
room temperature on an L1 sensor chip. Large unilamellar vesicles
(LUVs) were loaded on equilibrated sensor chip (20 mM MES, 150 mM
NaCl, pH 5.7). Reference flow cell contained LUVs composed only of
POPC (representing negative control as LLO requires cholesterol for
efficient membrane binding), whereas active flow cell contained LUVs
with POPC and cholesterol at 3:2 (mol:mol) ratio. The LUV-coated chip
surface was prepared as described. All protein
samples for SPR measurements contained 10 mM DTT. For studies regarding
binding of proteins or protein complexes to membranes, 100 nM Y406A,
5 μM D22, or premixed samples of 5 μM D22 and 100 nM Y406A
(incubated for 45 min at room temperature) were injected over the
LUV-coated surfaces for 3 min at a flow rate 5 μL/min and dissociated
for 20 min. For studies of interactions of D22 with membrane-bound
proteins, 100 nM LLO or Y406A was injected over LUV-coated surfaces
for 3 min at flow rate 5 μL/min, followed by dissociation for
5 min. Following one blank injection, 5 μM D22 was injected
over LLO bound to vesicles for 3 min at a flow rate 5 μL/min
and left to dissociate for 20 min. Blank injections were subtracted
from sample sensorgrams to eliminate the influence of buffer and DTT.
Data was processed with Biaevaluation v3.2 (GE Healthcare, United
Kingdom) software. Three individual experiments were conducted for
each case. Sedimentation
assays were
carried out in the buffered system (20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl) at pH
5.7. For studying binding of D22 complexed with binding partner to
membranes, protein pairs (LLO + D22 or Y406A + D22) with D22 in 5
× molar excess were first incubated for 15 min at room temperature
and then multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) in 2000 × molar excess
of lipids were added. For studying interaction of D22 with membrane-inserted
LLO or Y406A, LLO or Y406A was first incubated with MLVs for 15 min,
followed by addition of D22. Those mixtures were left to incubate
for an additional 15 min at room temperature and then centrifuged
at 16 100 for 15 min. Supernatants were transferred
to fresh microtubes and centrifuged again, whereas pellets were washed
with 50 μL of the buffer (resuspended and centrifuged again)
and finally resuspended in 15 μL of the buffer. Samples were
analyzed in the presence of 10 mM DTT with SDS-PAGE, showing MLV-bound
portion in pellet and unbound molecules in supernatant. Proteins were
visualized with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United
States) and the amount of bound D22 was determined by densitometry
by using ImageJ. Bovine erythrocytes, stored at 4 °C
in Alsevier preservative, were washed four times with resuspension
in the erythrocyte buffer (20 mM MES, 140 mM NaCl, pH 5.7) and centrifugation
at 800 for 5 min at room temperature. Erythrocytes
were diluted with erythrocyte buffer to yield absorbance of 1.0 at
630 nm, which was determined by microplate reader Synergy MX (Biotek,
United States). 50 μL of LLO or Y406A (final concentration 2.3
nM) was mixed with 50 μL of D22 (final concentration 5 μM)
and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Afterward, 100 μL
of erythrocyte suspension was added to each well. The final volume
in all wells was 200 μL. Absorbance at 630 nm was measured every
20 s for 20 min at 25 °C. Relative rate of hemolytic activity
was determined as the ratio of maximal hemolytic rate in the presence
and absence of D22, respectively. GUVs were mixed with the
buffer (10 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.5, or 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 8.0), fluorescent dextran of 10 kDa in size (Sigma; FD10, final
concentration of 1 mg/mL) and proteins in the following combinations:
50 nM Y406A alone, 5 μM D22M alone or premixed 50 nM Y406A +
5 μM D22M. Mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature
before imaging. Images were recorded on DMI6000 CS inverted microscope
with TCS SP5 laser scanning system (both Leica Microsystems, Germany)
with a 63 × oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.4).
The rhodamine-containing GUV membrane was excited at 550 nm, and emission
was detected from 570 to 600 nm. FD10 were excited at 488 nm, and
emission was detected from 497 to 527 nm. Percent of permeabilization
was calculated from green channel fluorescent intensities in ImageJ
software, namely fluorescent intensities inside the vesicles were
divided by background intensities outside the vesicles. For each condition
50 to 500 GUVs were analyzed. Calcein Release from SUVs
and LUVs POPC:Chol 3:2 (mol:mol)
lipids were used to prepare SUVs and POPC:Chol 1:1 (mol:mol) lipids
for LUVs, both in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 80 mM calcein,
pH 8.0. Excess calcein was removed from vesicles suspension by gravity
gel filtration on the Sephadex G-50 matrix (GE Healthcare, United
Kingdom). Concentration of POPC and cholesterol was enzymatically
determined with Phospholipids C kit and Free Cholesterol E kit (Wako
Diagnostics, United States), respectively. Size and uniformity of
SUVs and LUVs were checked with Dynamic Light Scattering (Zetasizer
Nano, Malvern Panalytical, United Kingdom). We followed calcein release
from SUVs in 96-well nontransparent microtiter plates (Costar, United
States) with microplate reader Synergy MX (Biotek, United States).
Vesicles with calcein were complemented with various combinations
of 1 μM LLO or Y406A, and 5 μM D22 in buffer containing
10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA at pH 6.5 or 8.0. From obtained
fluorescence signals, we subtracted the fluorescence of the background,
containing only vesicles with calcein and D22. Total release of calcein
from SUVs was obtained by adding 2 mM detergent Triton X-100. To follow
calcein release from LUVs, we used fluorimeter LS 55 Fluorescence
Spectrometer (PerkinElmer, United States), measuring in a cuvette
with final volume of 1 mL. Final concentration of lipids was 50 μM.
Baseline fluorescence was followed for 300 s before the addition of
proteins Y406A (30 nM final concentration) or D22 (1 μM final
concentration). For the Y406A protein activation, pH was lowered to
pH 6.5 by addition of 3 μL 7% HCl. For the Y406A protein inhibition,
D22 was used either by immediate addition (10 s) after activation
of Y406A or by preincubation of D22 and Y406A before or after addition
to LUVs before or after lowering the pH. Fluorescence was then followed
for at least 400 s before the addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration
of 2 mM) to achieve full release of calcein. Conjugation and Cleavage
of D22M from MLVs POPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG2000Mal
60:38:2 (molar ratio) and POPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG2000PDP 60:38:2 (molar
ratio) mixtures were used to prepare MLVs in 20 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl,
pH 8.0. D22M was conjugated on MLVs  maleimide
conjugation (for MMP-9 cleavage) or PDP (for cleavage with the reducing
agent) at 25 °C and shaking at 500 rpm under argon atmosphere
overnight. Excess D22M was removed by centrifugation (800, 8 min, 20 °C) and addition of buffer. First, the cleavage
success of D22M from MLVs was analyzed by addition of 0.1 μg
MMP-9 or 10 mM TCEP and incubation at 25 °C for 30 min. Afterward,
the sample was centrifuged, and supernatant and pellet were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE. Second, the binding of Y406A to D22M conjugated-MLVs
and additional cleavage was analyzed. For this experiment, 1 μg
of Y406A was added to MLVs with previously conjugated D22M and incubated
for 30 min at 25 °C. Then the sample was centrifuged, the supernatant
was saved for SDS-PAGE analysis, the pellet was resuspended in the
buffer, and 0.1 μg MMP-9 or 10 mM TCEP were added and incubated
for 30 min at 25 °C. The sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant
and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Calcein Release from MLVs
with Conjugated D22M Calcein
release was followed by using 96 well microtiter plates (Costar, United
States). Here, DSPE-PEG2000Mal 60:38:2 MLVs conjugated with D22M were
used for the cleavage experiments of D22M with MMP-9 and DSPE-PEG2000PDP
60:38:2 MLVs were used for the cleavage experiments of D22M with reducing
agent TCEP. Final volume of reactions was 50 μL. First, the
background fluorescence of 0.5 mM MLVs and buffer 20 mM HEPES, 300
mM NaCl, pH 8.0 (in the case of experiments with MMP-9 buffer also
contained 10 mM CaCl, 100 μM ZnSO) was
measured. Then Y406A was added at a final 500 nM concentration to
the MLVs, and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and 600 rpm. Afterward,
0.1 μg MMP-9 or 10 mM TCEP was added (incubated at 25 °C
and 600 rpm for 30 min). Finally, 0.5 μL 3.5% HCl was added
(incubated at 25 °C and 600 rpm for 30 min). Triton X-100 was
added to achieve full release of the calcein. Fluorescence signal
was measured by the Synergy MX microplate reader (Biotek, United States). For all experiments, raw data
points are presented as circles on graphs, together with mean values
± standard deviation (SD). Unpaired two-tailed  tests assuming equal variances were performed using Origin 8.1 to
present the differences between samples. Equalities of variances were
assessed by two-sample -test. A significant difference
was determined by -value <0.05. All the experiments
were replicated at least three times and represented biological replicates..
