The development
of more sustainable
materials production is an urgent need for our current society. Traditional
materials production processes can utilize massive quantities of polluting
chemicals, and too often the products are not naturally degradable. One newly emerging approach to solve this problem
is the production of materials by bacteria, either synthetically modified or unmodified. Many bacteria can carry out advanced
chemical reactions to produce materials, including amyloid-based adhesives, biobased electrical switches, microbially produced nacre, and a variety of bioplastics, under
ambient conditions without using or producing toxic compounds. However,
current microbial materials production techniques do not allow the
generation of bespoke material structures in a reliable or reproducible
way. To allow for the production of complex patterned biomaterials,
we have coupled bacterial materials production with 3D printing technology. Additive manufacturing allows for the
production of tailored products
fulfilling individual needs and enables entrepreneurs and companies
to produce small batches or only on-demand. A wide variety of 3D printing approaches have been developed for
additive manufacturing of nonbiological materials, including stereolithography,
selective laser sintering, electron beam melting (EBM), Laser Engineered
Net Shaping, and PolyJet. The vast majority of
current 3D printing techniques involve one or more steps that are
deadly for cells. Therefore, new technologies have been developed
for cellular printing with medical and biological applications including
visualization, education, and transplantation. To date, these
techniques are quite expensive (between 5000 and 200 000 USD) and not yet well adapted for bacteria. The area of biological printing is primarily dominated by three
different technologies. Thermal inkjet bioprinting uses CT or MRI
images as guides to deploy fluid dots layer by layer, which solidify
to a gel after a short heating phase in the extruder. Direct write bioprinting utilizes print-heads made of syringes
or needles that transport liquid bioink  mechanical
or pneumatic systems and uses a low-melting-point scaffold material. Spheroid organ printing employs tiny tissue spheroids to assist
the self-organizational and self-assembling character of real tissues. A few efforts have been made to apply these
technologies to bacterial printing, but all current approaches suffer
limitations of poor spatial resolution or require laborious clean-room fabrication of microstructures that
shape the printed bacteria. To achieve
a cost-efficient technology for bacterial printing that is compatible
with incubation of printed bacteria at elevated temperatures, a new
technology must be developed that allows high printing resolution
without the requirement for cleanroom facilities. Our newly
developed microbial 3D printer can deposit bacteria cells
in specific three-dimensional patterns for the ultimate goal of materials
production. Our printing platform uses a modified commercially available
3D printer to extrude a mixture of bacteria and alginate that solidifies
into a gel upon contact with a calcium chloride-treated printing surface.
This combination of straightforward chemistry and easy, readily available
technology enabled us to print reproducible 3-dimensional samples
with high spatial resolution. The combination of our straightforward
technique to print 3D microbial structures with the material-modifying
properties of bacteria will result in high-resolution deposition of
bacteria and the fabrication of spatially patterned materials. In order to
create a straightforward
bacterial 3D printer, multiple modifications were made to an inexpensive
(300 USD) commercial 3D printer (A). The extruder of the printer was removed
and replaced with a pipet tip (B, 3a) and system of tubing (B, 3c). This alteration allows the liquid
biological ink (“bioink”) to be transported under ambient
temperatures that are amenable to microbes, rather than the elevated
temperatures that are applied to melt plastic filament. A secondary
pipet tip was affixed to the printhead (B, 3b) to allow for rapid alternation between
the deposition of different types of bioink. A syringe pump (A, 1) was added to
the system to generate continuous but adjustable flows of bioink through
the sets of tubing into the pipet tips. Printed shapes are created
through the flow of bioink through the movable printhead while it
is in motion, the trajectory of which is programmably controlled by
an external computer. The shape of printed objects can be created  through computer-aided design (CAD) software programs,
then converted into printing instructions for the 3D printer using
slicing and printer-specific software programs. These adaptations
can be performed on all 3D printing systems that employ an accessible
and removable extruder. A custom bioink was developed that would allow bacteria and
chemical
substrates for materials production to flow through the printhead
in liquid state, then rapidly solidify upon contact with the printing
surface to form a stably patterned shape. The bioink consists of live
bacteria mixed with dissolved alginate. When the bioink is extruded
onto a surface containing calcium ions during the printing process,
cross-linking of the alginate molecules is triggered, forming a stable,
biocompatible aerogel scaffold within seconds. In order to optimize the bioink composition, the alginate and calcium
ion concentration were systematically varied (from 0.5% w/v to 6%
w/v alginate; and 0.0087 mol/cm to 0.44 mol/cm CaCl) and tested in the printing system. Insufficient
concentrations of alginate and calcium ions resulted in poor gelation
and low printing resolution, while excessive concentrations led to
premature gelation of the bioink, blocking the pipet tip and preventing
further printing. The optimal conditions were found to be 1 M CaCl and 2.5% w/v alginate. With our printer system, each printed
layer can only contain materials that are present in the active syringe;
the mixture of materials from two different syringes within one layer
is not possible due to the rate of scaffold formation. However, a
wide range of different types of materials is compatible with alginate
polymerization and may be admixed in the active syringe for inclusion
in individual printed layers. Bacterial 3D printing system. (A) Overview of

and Resolution http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00395/suppl_file/sb6b00395_si_001.avi The reproducibility
and consistency of the printing process was assessed by analyzing
patterned monolayers that were printed using the optimized bioink.
An elliptical form with two long straight lines on each side was chosen
as the printing object in order to test the performance of the printer
in fabricating both curved and straight-edged structures (A, ). Following printing, the width of
each printed structure was measured at six different positions, sampling
a variety of straight and curved portions. No statistically significant
differences were seen among any of the widths measured at the same
position in different prints (ANOVA, -value: 0.964,
CV%: 11.16) (B). These data indicate that our printer and bioink can fabricate
printed structures of varying shapes in a consistently uniform manner. In order to maximize the printer resolution, a range of printing
parameters was tested. The two most critical factors affecting the
printed line width were found to be the extrusion rate of the syringe
pump and the movement speed of the printhead, in agreement with previous
work. A range of printhead movement speeds
(100–500 mm/min) and syringe pump extrusion rates (17–50
μL/min) were applied to print straight lines of bioink. In general,
increased printing resolution could only be achieved by adjusting
both parameters in parallel: , slower printhead
movement speeds required slower syringe pump rates. Other less-critical
factors contributing to printer resolution were the distance between
the printhead and the printing surface, as well as the uniformity
of the printing surface. The narrowest line width obtainable was 1.00
± 0.15 mm, achieved with a printhead movement speed of 200 mm/min
and a syringe pump extrusion rate of 33 μL/min (A). The printer can be directed to deposit bioink directly on
top of
previously printed material to create multilayered structures. A second
aerogel layer can be printed on top of a base layer at a range of
different syringe pump extrusion rates, with no modification of the
printing commands (A). Fabrication of structures taller than two layers in height
requires an increase of the -position of the printhead
by 0.15 mm/layer. Stacked layers of bioink are able to solidify due
to interaction with calcium ions that have diffused from the printing
surface up through the first printed layer(s). Each additional printed
layer resulted in a fractional increase in the width of the final
structure, due to the time required for the new layer to gelate (A, B). No significant
change in the final width was observed when the time between printing
of successive layers was varied between 40 and 240 s (Student’s  test, -value: 0.037, CV: 18.36, CV: 20.82), indicating that multilayered
structures can be printed at different paces with no loss of resolution.
The total time required to print a 14-layered ellipse with a pause
of 40 s between printing successive layers was 15 min. To characterize
the spatial resolution of 3-dimensional printed
structures, 14-layered elliptical structures were printed. The structures’
widths were measured following deposition of each layer. The heights
of the structures were measured for only a subset of layers, since
each height measurement required removal of the gel from the printing
surface, halting the printing process. The average line width increased
significantly but incrementally for the first six layers, with an
average increase of 0.14 ± 0.01 mm per layer between layers 1
and 6 (B).
Following the sixth layer, the line widths approached a plateau; no
significant differences were observed between the line widths of any
of the layers between layers 6 and 14 (ANOVA + Tukey  test, -value: 0.995). The height of
the printed material was observed to increase continually, by an average
of 0.16 ± 0.02 mm per layer. The final 14-layered structures
were 2.14 ± 0.11 mm in height, with a width of 2.32 ± 0.37
mm. These measurements indicate that our printing system is capable
of fabricating 3-dimensional structures at submillimeter-scale
precision in all dimensions. Further improvements in resolution may
be possible by rebuilding our system using a commercial 3D printer
employing more accurate printhead positioning. Since some applications may require the printing
of multilayered
structures containing spatially separated bacterial strains, the internal
structure of multilayered printed bacteria was analyzed. Bilayered
structures were printed containing engineered , in which the bacteria in bottom layer of bioink expressed
the yellow fluorescent protein mVenus, and the bacteria in the top
layer expressed the blue fluorescent protein mCerulean. Each layer
was printed using separate tubing and pipet tips to prevent contamination
of the top layer by bacteria printed in the previous layer. After
24 h of incubation, the structure was imaged at different depths using
confocal microscopy, and the extent of bacterial mixing between the
layers was quantified through image analysis. The bottom layer was
81% ± 5% homogeneous, while the top layer was 93% ± 5% homogeneous
(). This analysis
indicates good separation of bacteria between adjacent printed layers,
even after extensive periods of incubation. The lower layer may have
been less pure due to incomplete solidification before printing of
the top layer, which could be improved  an increased
waiting time between printing of layers. Reproducible

exist between the width distributions of any of the different positions
(ANOVA, -value: 0.964). Printing at millimeter-scale

The printhead movement speed was 200 mm/min in all cases. The tops

respectively; the lines within the boxes are the median values; and

values. (B) The line width (blue) and line height (red) of printed

printed layers. Modified strains of  expressing
two different fluorescent proteins
were printed one on top of the other in a 2-layered square. After
24 h of incubation, the internal structure of the printed bacterial
layers was inspected by confocal microscopy. The bottom layer contained
81% ± 5% blue fluorescent cells, while the top layer contained
93% ± 5% yellow cells. Survival and Metabolic Activity of Printed Bacteria In order
for our alignate-based printing system to be successfully
applied to microbial materials production, bacteria must be able to
survive well within the alginate gel. To test this property,  was incorporated into alginate aerogels, and
gels were incubated for varying amounts of time from 0 to 48 h at
37 °C. The gels were then added to a solution of sodium citrate
to chelate the calcium ions and dissolve the gel. The samples were
grown on LB-agar plates to determine the number of viable cells (colony
forming units). An increase in colony forming units observed between
the first two data points may indicate that bacterial growth occurs
within the alginate gel during the first 24 h after gel production
(A). Thereafter,
colony forming units remained fairly constant for up to 48 h. Comparison
with bacteria that were incubated in nonprinted, liquid bioink indicated
that the printing process initially reduces the viability of  by approximately 50% (B). Thereafter, the levels of viable bacteria
in the nonprinted bioink remained nearly constant, likely due to nutrient
limitation. The dramatic increase in the number of viable bacteria
in the printed gel resulted in an overall increase in viability of
approximately 200% in comparison to the nonprinted bioink, which may
be due to the additional nutrients in the agar printing substrate
and the lower bacterial density after printing. Bacteria can thus
remain viable within the alginate gel of our bioink for at least 2
days following gel formation, providing sufficient time for microbial-mediated
materials production or patterning to occur. Both survival and metabolic activity of the printed bacteria
are
key factors to demonstrate the applicability of our printing system.
To assess the ability of our printed bacteria to create a product,  containing the rhamnose-inducible red fluorescent
protein RFP were printed onto an agar plate containing the rhamnose
inducer. The gel was incubated, and the color of the gel was monitored
over 48 h. After 8 h of incubation, the induced bioink showed a noticeable
red color, which became very intense after 48 h (). This experiment demonstrates
that our printed bioink is able to support the production of bacterially
made materials over short periods of time. Our printing system could
be readily applied to the patterned production of bacterially created
materials in a variety of different formats. Bioink containing both
active bacteria and material precursors could be printed onto a neutral
surface, to create a three-dimensionally patterned aerogel within
which the bacteria chemically convert the precursors to the desired
final product. The thorough commingling of bacteria and chemical substrates
within the gel in this configuration would lead to high efficiency
of material production. Alternately, alginate gel containing only
the chemical precursor could be printed and then immersed within a
liquid bacterial culture to create a final 3D-patterned material that
is largely bacteria-free. In a third scenario, bacteria-containing
bioink could be printed onto a surface that is coated with material
precursors, which the bacteria could then convert into a two-dimensionally
patterned final product. This approach has the appealing feature that
the alginate gel could be dissolved away after the fact, leaving behind
only the final material. The work shown here demonstrates the development
of macroscopic
material printing with millimeter-scale resolution using removable
aerogels and bacterial chemistry. This approach enables us also to
print precursor or supportive material directly with the bacteria.
Our printing technique is inexpensive, straightforward, and can produce
bacterial structures of a wide variety of three-dimensional shapes
without requiring printing scaffolds, excepting structures that contain
internal bridges or enclosed hollow spaces. Our technology is well-suited
for the use of wild-type organisms or synthetically modified bacteria,
which could be designed to carry out new combinations of microbial
reactions to create a great number of different types of materials.
Connecting our novel and straightforward bacteria printing techniques
with approaches of synthetic biology will further improve its value
as a “green” material production process and patterning
methodology. The ease and simplicity of our printing approach will
allow any interested research group to adapt and improve this process
at low cost for multiple possible applications. Robust bacterial survival
within printed alginate gels and planktonic
bioink. The number of colony forming units is shown for  printed within alginate gels (A) or as a planktonic sample (B),
incubated for varying amounts of time ( = 6). Error
bars indicate the standard error. Metabolic activity within printed alginate gels.  with and without a rhamnose-inducible RFP plasmid
were printed onto
a substrate containing rhamnose. Printed gels were incubated at 37
°C, and color changes were observed over time. The extruder and heater of a standard
3D printer (CoLiDo DIY) were removed and replaced by a pipet tip,
a tubing system, and a syringe pump (). Silicon tubing (VWR DENE 3100103/25) with
an inner diameter of 1 mm and an outer diameter of 3 mm was used to
connect a 200 μL pipet tip to a 10 mL syringe. The syringe was
loaded with 10 mL of printer bioink and mounted in a syringe pump
(ProSense B.V. NE-300). A secondary 200 μL pipet tip was affixed
to the printhead (3b in A) and connected to silicon tubing to allow for rapid exchange
of the pipet tip to deposit a second type of material. Printed objects
were drawn in the free online CAD program Tinkercad, sliced  the RepRap Slic3r software, and manually adapted and
implemented for printing using CoLiDo software. Bacterial Strains,
Plasmids, and Culturing K12 MG1655 was transformed with an SB101
plasmid containing RFP under the control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter.  Top10 cells were transformed with plasmids
AM420 or AM421. Cells were cultured overnight in LB media supplemented
with the appropriate antibiotic (25 μg/mL ampicillin or kanamycin)
at 37 °C with continuous shaking at 250 rpm. Plasmid AM420
is a p15A-derived plasmid carrying an ampicillin resistance gene,
a constitutively expressed  gene, and the gene
for the blue fluorescent protein mCerulean (gene sequence originally
from pZS2–123, Addgene plasmid
# 26598) behind an IPTG-inducible promoter. Plasmid AM421 is
a pSC101-derived plasmid carrying a kanamycin
resistance gene, a constitutively expressed  gene,
and the gene for the yellow fluorescent protein mVenus (gene sequence
originally from mVenus N1, Addgene plasmid
# 27793) behind an anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter. To obtain 10 mL of bioink containing , 10 mL of overnight bacterial culture (OD of approximately
2.5) were spun down at 4000 rpm for 3
min and the supernatant discarded. The cells were resuspended in 5
mL of sterile LB medium (Sigma-Aldrich). A 5 mL mixture of sodium
alginate (5% w/v, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the solution, followed
by vortexing. A Petri dish
(150 mm × 15 mm)
was filled with 20 mL of agar (1.5% w/v) dissolved in LB medium. The
printing surface was prepared by the equally distributed application
of 500 μL 1 M CaCl onto the agar surface. Resolution
and Height Measurements Printing resolution
was determined by measuring the width and height of printed samples
with a digital caliper (GEDORE No. 711) three times per position for
each layer. Prior to the start of printing, the Petri dish lid containing
the agar printing surface was affixed to the printer platform using
double-faced adhesive tape to prevent changes in the position of the
substrate during measurements. Width measurements were recorded for
successive layers printed onto the same base layer. Measurement positions
within printed ellipses were selected prior to printing: two random
points within curved end regions, two random points in straight-edged
side regions, and two random points in the transitional area between
curved and straight regions. To determine the height of printed samples,
the printed structure was removed from the agar printing surface,
therefore additional printed layers could not be added post measurement. Printing and Imaging of Layered Alginate Gels Containing Fluorescent
Bacteria Printing substrate including inducers (1 mM IPTG
to induce mCerulean expression, 50 ng/mL anhydrotetracycline to induce
mVenus expression) was prepared in a Petri dish. A sheet of dialysis
membrane (Spectra/Por 2 Dialysis Tubing, 12–14 kDa MWCO, Spectrum
Europe B.V., The Netherlands) was placed on the agar prior to printing,
to ensure diffusion of nutrients and inducers from the agar substrate
to the printed gel while facilitating eventual transfer of the gel
onto a microscope slide. A single rectangular layer of bioink was
printed containing  with AM421, then
a second rectangular layer of bioink containing  with AM420 was printed on top of the first layer, using separate
tubing and pipet tips to avoid bacterial cross-contamination. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the printed gels and underlying
dialysis membranes were sliced with a scalpel. Samples were transferred
onto a microscope slide and imaged with a Nikon A1 fluorescence
confocal microscope (magnification 200×, excitation wavelengths
457 or 514 nm, detected wavelengths 465–500 or 525–555
nm for mCerulean or mVenus, respectively). To determine bacterial survival,
5 mL of an overnight culture of  K12
MG1655 (OD of approximately 2.5) was spun down at 4000
rpm for 3 min and the supernatant discarded. The bacterial pellet
was resuspended in 5 mL of fresh LB medium containing 2% w/v sodium
alginate by vortexing until all ingredients were entirely dissolved.
A portion of the bioink was used to print a 6-layered rectangular
quadrangle. The gel was allowed to solidify for 30 min before the
first sample was taken. The remainder of the bioink was incubated
in unsolidified liquid form at 37 °C as a positive control showing
planktonic growth. After 0, 24, or 48 h of incubation at 37 °C,
0.3 g of the gel was removed and dissolved in 1.75 mL of 1 M sodium
citrate solution. For planktonic samples, 200 μL samples were
removed, containing approximately the same volume of bioink as that
sampled from the printed gel. Colony forming units (CFU) were determined
following the protocol of Karas () In short, each sample was serially diluted three
times (in 10-fold increments from 10 to 10), and 5 μL of each dilution was pipetted in
triplicate onto a LB-agar plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h, and visible colonies were counted. Production of RFP by Printed
Bacteria Two 6-layered,
square-shaped gels were printed on an LB-agar plate containing 0.2%
rhamnose. One gel contained  with a rhamnose-inducible
RFP-producing plasmid, and the other one contained wild-type  K12 MG1655. The agar around the printed gel
was removed to increase its visibility. The printed gels were photographed
under constant light conditions over a 48-h period. R-Studio was used to perform the
statistical analyses. All data sets were assumed to be normally distributed
and were checked for outliers with a Dixon’s Q-Test. Unless
noted, no outliers were removed from the data sets. One-way ANOVA
was used to compare multiple data sets, and two-sample Student’s  test was used for comparing two data sets. In cases where
the ANOVA test showed a significant difference, a Tukey’s  test was used to obtain an overview of all significant
differences occurring within the data set..
