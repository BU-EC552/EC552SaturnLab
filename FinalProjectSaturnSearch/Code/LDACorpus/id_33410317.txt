to the protocol for creating microsphere
dilutions for optical density calibration. The published version contains
errors that would that lead to an incorrect calibration curve if followed. Addition of a note regarding the manufacturer
concentration
of microspheres, as this information has now been removed from the
manufacturerâ€™s Web site, leading to confusion for readers regarding
how concentrations were calculated in the letter. Addition of a comment regarding the need to change values
in the calibration layout file if the user changes the experimental
conditions, for example, a different well volume. The following changes have been
made to Supplemental Method 2 in the :.
