A DNA watermark is a unique
synthetic nucleotide sequence that enables the identification and
traceability of its carrier when applying PCR amplification and sequencing
techniques. Application of the watermarks in living organisms started
recently with a purpose to protect R&D investments, to create
an information storage source, or to enable traceability of pathogenic
or endangered species. The literature reports successful embedding and subsequent
detection of the watermarks in DNA strands , as well as  using several model microorganisms (, , , , , and ), plants, and viruses. All these studies focused on a single locus for the watermark introduction,
with a few notable exceptions. First, the  genome  synthesis in which four large watermarks
(. 1 kb) were introduced to enable the differentiation
between the natural and synthetic copies of the  genome. Second, the Synthetic Yeast
2.0 (Sc2.0) project, where approximately 28 bp regions of each open
reading frame were recoded to distinguish synthetic from native genes
by PCR. Lastly, the recoding of the  genome, such that it uses 61 instead of 64
codons. The successes of these projects
reveal the potential of the watermarks for future development in synthetic
biology, particularly during large-scale genome remodeling projects,
where tagging the synthetic gene copies can enable the discrimination
between synthetic and native homologues. For instance, Kuijpers and
co-workers recently reported the pathway swapping strategy that enables
to redesign large, native essential pathways. Pathway swapping was demonstrated on the glycolytic and fermentation
pathways of , involving 12 catalytic
steps encoded by 26 genes. After a first genetic reduction leading
to a minimal glycolysis set of 13 genes, a second, synthetic set of these 13 genes was integrated in a single
locus on chromosome IX. Subsequently, the native copies of these 13
glycolytic genes were removed from their original chromosomal loci,
leading to SwYG, a yeast strain with a single locus, minimal glycolytic
pathway. However, the presence of two identical gene copies for all
glycolytic genes during the strain construction process led to complications.
First, in this intermediate strain carrying both native, scattered,
and synthetic, colocalized glycolytic genes, removal of the native
gene copies without harming the synthetic, identical copies integrated
on chromosome IX was challenging. Second, expression of the native
and synthetic genes could not be measured and compared. Both problems
can easily be addressed by embedding watermarks in the synthetic genes.
When judiciously placed in Protospacer Adjacent Motifs (PAM), watermarks
can disable CRISPR/Cas editing in the synthetic genes. When designed in coding regions (CDS), watermarks
can be used to identify native from watermarked mRNA molecules. Whether inserted in coding or noncoding regions, the major downside
of watermarks is the risk of unintended changes in the host physiology.
Watermarking in coding regions is potentially less challenging as
watermarks can be embedded in the CDS as silent mutation, taking advantage
of the redundancy of the genetic code encompassing 61 codons for only
20 amino acids. However, while “silent” or synonymous
mutations in CDS do not affect the amino acid sequence of the corresponding
protein, they can alter cells at different levels. Codons can be classified
as optimal and nonoptimal based on their frequency in the genome and
the abundance of tRNAs with complementary anticodons. It is now well established that cells use codon optimality to tune
protein expression. Highly expressed genes, such as genes encoding
the highly abundant glycolytic proteins, are enriched for optimal
codons. Furthermore, by tuning the translation rate,
codon optimality regulates the cotranslational folding of polypeptides
and plays a role in shaping proteins conformational states. More recently, it has been shown that codon optimality also modifies
mRNA structure, splicing, and stability. Codon optimality preservation
is therefore an important criterion to consider when introducing watermarks
without causing undesirable changes in gene function. There is however
little known about the impact of watermarking on cell physiology,
and remarkably few studies are dedicated to , a microbe intensively used in synthetic biology
developments. Heider and Barnekow demonstrated
that watermarking of  in  did not affect the vacuolar function of the corresponding protein. Liss and co-workers expressed a watermarked GFP
in  and showed minimal impact on
GFP protein by Western blotting. In the
Sc2.0 project in every ORF larger than 500 bp at least two 19–28
bp PCRtags were introduced, which were recoded approximately 33–60%.
Every strain with a native chromosome replaced by a synthetic version
showed no or minor fitness defects, and transcript profiling showed
only few genes changed in expression. Whether these transcript changes originated from the PCRtags was
not always investigated, and it is unclear whether these PCRtags allow
discrimination between native and synthetic mRNAs when both are present
in the cell. Therefore, there remains a strong need for studies proposing
a watermarking strategy with the ability to distinguish between native
and synthetic DNA and mRNA, validated by a systematic, quantitative
exploration of the impact of watermarking on transcription, translation,
and general physiology. To fill
this knowledge gap, using  as eukaryotic
paradigm, this study designed, implemented and experimentally
validated a systematic approach to watermark DNA with minimal alteration
of yeast physiology. The impact of simultaneously watermarking 13
genes encoding abundant proteins involved in the major pathway for
sugar utilization (, glycolysis and alcoholic
fermentation) on metabolism, transcriptome, and enzyme activity was
explored using batch cultures in tightly controlled bioreactors. Watermarked
transcripts were segregated from native ones using the karyollelle
specific expression detection method. Finally, the ability of watermarks to protect synthetic genes from
CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing was evaluated. Design
and  Validation of the Watermarking
Strategy http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf The presence of watermarks in the CDS of glycolytic
genes shall enable discrimination of the watermarked  native DNA and mRNA sequences with a minimal effect on transcript
and protein levels, activity of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway
and ultimately, yeast physiology. Finding the optimal trade-off between
robust watermark detection by sequencing and minimal physiological
impact was therefore the main design principle of the watermarking
strategy. On the basis of current RNA sequencing resolution (Illumina
platform with an error rate of <1%), at least five nucleotide substitutions
were required to distinguish watermarked from native sequences using
random single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Codon replacement was
performed on the amino acids encoded by four to six alternative triplets
(A, G, P, T, V, L, R, S), favoring triplets for which only the third
base pair of the triplet was different from the original codon. The
codon with the most similar percentage of abundance when referring
to the codon usage table of  () was chosen, avoiding triplets leading
to more than 20% variation in abundance when possible. The structure
of the 5′ region of the mRNA is important for translation efficiency.
Not only does the folding energy at the 5′ end affect translation
initiation, but the presence of nonoptimal codons close to the initiation
site can stall ribosomes, thereby hampering translation initiation. Furthermore, as translation initiation is considered as translation
limiting step, and following the example
of Annaluru and colleagues, the first
101 nt of the CDS were preserved. The optimal distribution of watermarks
over the remaining CDS stretch was tested with two  approaches using . In the first approach, watermarks
were colocalized in two 100 nt regions, one in the middle of the CDS,
and the other located 10 nt upstream of the stop codon (A). In the second approach,
base pair substitutions were equally spread over the CDS sequence,
every 85 nt (B). In both approaches 11 watermarks were introduced, which resulted
in an overall change in codon usage of 0.57 for the first and 0.47
for the second method (, . See  section for calculation of the change in codon usage).
In order to evaluate the discriminatory potential of RNA sequencing
with these two strategies, 100 bp paired-end sequence reads were simulated
for both watermarked and native  copies (see  section). These data were processed using
the k-mer method developed by Gehrmann , only considering reads containing watermarks
(see  section), to selectively quantify
watermarked and native reads. On average 52.5% of the reads were captured
when using the first approach with clustered watermarks, while 99.4%
were detected using the second approach, with watermarks spread over
the CDS ().
The Pearson correlation coefficient between generated and measured
reads was above 0.99 for both methods, indicating that both methods
are able to retrieve the variation in abundance across the samples,
required for differential expression. The second approach resulted
in a better sequence coverage and slightly lower codon usage change.
However, the first approach is less labor intensive when manual design
is performed, and is less likely to affect cotranslational folding, as a shorter part of the CDS undergoes codon
usage change. The first method was therefore selected as watermarking
strategy (detailed in  and ) and used to edit  the CDS of 13 genes of glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation (, , , , , , , , , , , , and , see example for watermarking for  and  in ). This resulted in a reasonably low change in codon usage of the
watermarked genes of 0.5 on average (). Using simulated data, we compared the performance of the k-mer
method with traditional alignment and found that the k-mer method
was able to achieve a higher read retrieval rate than alignment indicating
a more accurate transcription estimate (). The watermarked CDS were synthesized with flanks compatible
with Golden Gate assembly (plasmids pGGKp137 to pGGKp150, ). Comparison of two watermarking strategies.

clustered watermarks. (B) Second strategy with watermarks distributed

the % of sequencing reads that can be captured by the two watermarking
strategies, calculated from  simulated 100
bp paired-end sequencing reads. Strain Construction Strategy and Confirmation http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf In the
SwYG strain, the set of genes involved
in glycolysis and fermentation was reduced from 26 to 13 and relocalized
to a single locus (Single Locus Glycolysis, SinLoG) on chromosome
IX. The SwYG strain is a perfect platform to rapidly remodel glycolysis
and alcoholic fermentation and test multiple (heterologous) variants.
SwYG was therefore used as starting strain to express the watermarked
genes. Using simultaneous Cas9-mediated genome editing and  assembly, the entire glycolytic and fermentation
pathways composed of 13 watermarked genes were integrated in one step
in the  locus on chromosome V. The watermarked
genes were framed by the native, standardized corresponding promoters
and terminators (800 bp and 300 bp respectively). Three helper elements,
two Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) and a selection marker
were included in the SinLoGs design (). Two active ARSs ( and ) were added on both ends of the . 35 Kb long SinLoGs to minimize the risk of perturbing
DNA replication of this long DNA stretch. A selection marker was used
to facilitate screening for correct integration and removal of the
SinLoGs. The native SinLoG, present in the  locus
on chromosome IX, was then removed using the Cas9 endonuclease, resulting
in strain IMX1770 ( and ). To obtain an isogenic control strain, the same procedure was followed
to construct a strain with native SinLoG, framed by the same promoters
and terminators as the watermarked genes, and integrated in the same  locus on chromosome V ( and ). This control
strain was named IMX1771. The genome of both strains was sequenced,
confirming the presence of a single, correctly assembled glycolytic
pathway at the targeted chromosomal location. Sequencing revealed
the absence of mutations in the coding regions of the glycolytic and
marker genes but identified a few mutations in the promoter and terminator
regions of the glycolytic and selection marker expression cassettes
(). In IMX1770, a single Single
Nucleotide Variation (SNV) was found in the promoter of  and  and in the terminator of  and . In IMX1771, a single SNV was identified
in the  terminator, and a short TA stretch was
missing in the promoter of . http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf A third strain, IMX2028 was constructed. IMX2028
harbored a double
SinLoG, one located on chromosome IX carrying the watermarked genes
and another on one carrying the native yeast genes on chromosome V
(IMX2028,  and ). Unfortunately,
genome sequencing revealed the deletion of a large region of the mitochondrial
DNA (). The strain IMX2028 was
constructed to evaluate the performance of the k-mer method to discriminate
between watermarked and native genes when present in the same strain.
Despite IMX2028 respiration deficiency, the watermarked and native
SinLoG that this strain carried were essentially faithful to the  design (),
which made this strain still valuable for differential quantification
of watermarked and native genes. Construction of SinLoG
(Single Locus Glycolysis) strains IMX1770
and IMX1771 using the glycolysis swapping strategy. (A) A newly designed glycolysis is integrated in the  locus by simultaneous CRISPR/Cas9-aided editing of  and  assembly of glycolytic
expression cassettes and helper fragments (ARS418, ARS1211 and the
selection marker ). The > and < signs next
to the gene names indicate the directionality of transcription and
letters indicate the synthetic homologous recombination (SHR) sequence
which was used for assembly. (B) Subsequently, the Single Locus Glycolysis
present in the  locus was excised by double editing
using CRISPR/Cas9 and replaced by the  selection
marker. The set of genes integrated in  is then
the sole set of glycolytic genes present in the newly constructed
strain and is essential for growth on glucose. Strain
construction workflow. The Switchable Yeast Glycolysis (SwYG)
strain, IMX1338, served as parental strain to introduce in chromosome
V a SinLoG (Single Locus Glycolysis) with native ORFs and standardized
promoters/terminators (IMX1747) as well as with watermarked ORFs and
standardized promoters/terminators (IMX1717). From both strains the
native SinLoG in chromosome IX with variable promoters and terminators
was removed (resulting in strain IMX1771 and IMX1770, respectively).
After removal of  from strain IMX1771 (native
ORFs) the SinLoG with watermarked ORFs was introduced in chromosome
IX, resulting in a strain with double glycolysis (IMX2028). List of Strains Used

the impact of DNA watermarking on yeast physiology, the watermarked
strain IMX1770 and its isogenic control IMX1771 were grown in aerobic
batch bioreactors and their growth kinetics were compared. Both strains
were prototrophic, meaning that they fully relied on glucose, the
sole carbon and energy source catabolized  glycolysis,
to produce the required cellular building blocks and therefore to
grow. The two strains displayed identical growth rates (0.33 ±
0.004 h and 0.32 h ±
0.002 h for IMX1770 and IMX1771, respectively)
as well as glucose and O uptake rates, ethanol and CO production rates and yields ( and ). Both strains passed the diauxic shift and grew equally
well using the ethanol, which was produced during fermentative growth
on glucose, as carbon and energy source (). Watermarking of glycolytic and alcoholic fermentation
genes therefore did not alter metabolic fluxes and the overall physiological
responses during fast respiro-fermentative on glucose and full respiratory
growth on ethanol. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf Watermarking might affect protein
folding and consequently function.
However, as yeast glycolysis is characterized by an overcapacity of
its enzymes, mild variations of glycolytic enzymes activities might
not be detectable by growth kinetics. The 12 specific activity assays
of the 13 enzymes (Pfk1 and Pfk2 are subunits of a hetero-octameric
phosphofructokinase) encoded by the watermarked
genes were therefore assayed . The specific
activity of these 13 enzymes was, with the exception of Gpm1, remarkably
similar between watermarked and native strains (-values above 0.05; Student  test, two-tailed,
homoscedastic). For all enzymes, specific activities were remarkably
similar to protein abundance, including a 1.6-fold decrease in specific
activity and protein abundance for Gpm1 (, ). Watermarking therefore did not affect or marginally affect protein
expression and functionality (). To further explore the potential impact of
watermarking on yeast
physiology, the transcriptome of IMX1771 and IMX1770 grown in aerobic
batch reactors was compared. The transcriptional response of these
two strains was remarkably similar (). The native and watermarked glycolytic
genes were the only differentially expressed genes between the two
strains. This differential expression reflects the absence of the
native genes and therefore their lack of expression in IMX1770, and
the absence and lack of expression of the watermarked genes in IMX1771.
However, expression levels of the native and watermarked genes in
IMX1771 and IMX1770, respectively, were highly similar (A). Physiological characterization of IMX2028 confirmed
the respiration
deficiency suggested by the absence of mitochondrial DNA. The k-mer
method was able to selectively quantify expression of the native and
watermarked genes. While expression of glycolytic and respiration
genes might differ in IMX2028 as compared to IMX1770 and IMX1771 due
to the mutations in mitochondrial DNA and associated respiration deficiency,
the relative expression of glycolytic and fermentation genes, expressed
from the same promoters in the native and watermarked SinLoG, was
not expected to differ between the native and watermarked genes in
this strain. Accordingly, and in agreement with the similarity of
the expression levels between IMX1770 and IMX1771, transcript levels
of native and watermarked genes in IMX2028 were identical (B). Watermarking
of 13 highly expressed genes of central carbon metabolism,
essential for glucose utilization, had therefore no impact on yeast
transcriptome and physiology. Physiological characterization of strains with native

CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf DNA binding and editing by CRISPR/Cas9
requires the presence at
the targeted site of a specific PAM recognition sequence. A single nucleotide variation in this sequence
can abolish Cas9 ability to introduce a double strand DNA break. This feature is particularly interesting when
considering selective editing of identical or highly similar sequences.
If strategically designed, watermarks can enable targeted editing
of a watermarked gene, leaving the native copy intact or conversely,
prevent editing of the watermarked gene while cutting the native copy.
Guide RNAs (gRNAs) selectively targeting the native copies of  and  for CRISPR/Cas9 editing were
designed (), inserted into expression
vectors and transformed to IMX1717, a double SinLoG strain and direct
ancestor of IMX1770 (). Double-stranded DNA fragments of 120 nt were supplied during
transformation to repair  homologous recombination
the break induced by CRISPR/Cas9. As the sequence of the native and
watermarked genes is identical with the exception of watermarks, a
single primer set designed just outside the open reading frame can
be used to amplify both copies of  or  in a single PCR reaction using IMX1717 genomic DNA
as template. Ran on a gel, the PCR products of this reaction would
lead to a single band corresponding to both the native and watermarked
copies of  or . Selective
editing would lead to the appearance of a second, smaller band on
gel, corresponding to the edited copy of  or . Out of 15 colonies of IMX1717 transformed with the
gRNA targeting , three displayed two bands demonstrating
editing of a single  copy (). Five out of 15 colonies of IMX1717 transformed
with the gRNA targeting  showed selective editing
(). For two
transformants per gene ( and ) showing two bands on the gel, sequencing the largest band confirmed
the presence of the watermarked sequence only, confirming selective
editing of the native  and  (). It has recently been shown
that cells can use chromosomal DNA with high homology to repair a
CRISPR/Cas mediated DNA break, leading to loss of heterozygosity. In the present case, it means that cells could
repair the induced DNA break in the targeted, native gene copy with
its watermarked homologue, resulting in two copies of the watermarked
gene, but a single PCR product and therefore a single band on gel.
Sequencing of the unique PCR product of four colonies in which editing
of  and  was considered
unsuccessful revealed that, for all tested colonies, the  and  genes were cut by CRISPR/Cas but repaired
by (part of) the watermarked allele. Editing of the targeted, native
genes by CRISPR/Cas9 was therefore highly efficient (100% of the tested
colonies), however the DNA break was repaired either by the supplied
repair DNA fragment or by the watermarked homologue. Diagnostic PCR for selective
editing of native glycolytic genes.
Separation of PCR products resulting from outside–outside amplification

for  (A) and  (B) from transformants
of IMX1717 (double SinLoG). (A) Lanes 1–15 show the PCR results
of amplification of the  locus of randomly picked
colonies. Successful editing of the locus results in a DNA fragment
with a length of 670 bp. No editing of the locus results in a DNA
fragment with a length of 2177 bp. Primers 11915 and 4667 were used.
Lanes 1, 5, and 15 display bands of both sizes revealing selective
editing. (B) Lane 1–15 show the PCR results of amplification
of the  locus of randomly picked colonies. Successful
editing of the locus results in a DNA fragment with a length of 378
bp. No editing of the locus results in a DNA fragment with a length
of 1125 bp. Primers 3514 and 6406 were used. Lanes 9–11, 13,
and 15 display bands of both sizes revealing selective editing. A
negative control is indicated with “C-“ (IMX1338, SinLog).
In the lanes indicated with “L”, GeneRuler DNA ladder
mix was loaded. 1% (w/v) agarose in TAE. The present study offers an innocuous watermarking
strategy for
coding regions that enables the discrimination of DNA and mRNA by
sequencing through a k-mer approach and facilitates selective editing
of watermarked and nonwatermarked sequences. While the design of watermarked
genes was performed manually in the present study, it can easily be
automated when a larger number of genes is concerned, with software
similar to for example GeneDesign. The set of genes chosen to test the watermarking strategy encodes
highly abundant proteins that are generally considered to operate
at overcapacity, which means that the capacity of the enzymes is considerably
larger than the actual  flux. While this overcapacity
might obscure physiological responses, a closer inspection of transcript
levels and enzyme activities confirmed the watermarks' harmlessness
for . Only one of the 13 tested
genes showed an activity of the enzyme encoded by the watermarked
allele significantly decreased (. 1.6-fold) as
compared to the activity of the enzyme encoded by the native allele
(phosphoglucomutase encoded by ), which could
be explained by a similar decrease in Gpm1 protein abundance. As native
and watermarked transcript levels were identical for , the lower enzyme abundance in the watermarked strain might result
from a slightly lower translation efficiency. Neither the watermarking
specifics (type of codon substitution, change in codon usage, .) of this particular protein, nor information from literature
hinted toward the mechanism underlying this decreased protein abundance.
A recent study, combining measurements of protein synthesis rate with
ribosome footprinting data confirmed that Gpm1, like most glycolytic
proteins, has a fast synthesis rate. Applying
the same approach to watermarked strains could help characterizing
the impact of nucleotide substitution on translational efficiency. Another particularity of glycolytic genes is their high codon optimality
(on average . 90% of optimal codons according to
Hanson and Coller). While one could argue
that this set of genes might not be representative of the yeast genome,
to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence that such genes
are more or less robust toward changes in codon frequency than genes
with lower levels of codon optimality. For future studies it would
be interesting to explore if codon optimality affects genes sensitivity
to watermarking. Strains and Cultivation
Conditions The  strains
used in the study belong to CEN.PK family and are listed
in . Liquid
cultures were grown in 500 mL shake flasks filled with 100 mL of medium
at 30 °C with 200 rpm agitation. Complex media (further referred
to as YPD) contained 10 g·L yeast extract,
20 g·L peptone and 20 g·L glucose. Synthetic minimal medium (further referred as SMG) consisted
of 3 g g·L KHPO,
0.5 g·L MgSO·7HO, 5 g·L (NH)SO, 1 mL·L of a trace element solution,
and 1 mL·L of a vitamin solution as previously
described and supplemented with 20 g·L glucose. For solid medium, 20 g·L agar was added prior autoclaving. When selection in SMG was required,
(NH)SO was replaced with 3 g·L KSO and 2.3 g·L filter-sterilized urea, and the medium was supplemented
with 200 mg·L of G418, hygromycin B or 10
mM acetamide. For the counterselection purpose,
1 mg·mL 5-FOA (Zymo Research, Irvine, US)
was added to SMG supplemented with uracil (150 mg·L). For plasmid propagation,  XL1-Blue cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) were grown in Lysogeny broth (LB) medium supplied
with 100 mg Lampicillin or 25 mg·L chloramphenicol
at 37 °C with 180 rpm agitation. Yeast and bacterial frozen stocks
were prepared by addition of 30% (v/v) glycerol to exponentially growing
cultures. Strain aliquots were stored at −80 °C. PCR reactions for diagnostic
purposes were performed using DreamTaq DNA polymerase Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Walthman, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For high fidelity PCR reactions, Phusion High-Fidelity
DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used following the supplier’s
manual. Oligonucleotides of desalted or PAGE quality, depending on
the purpose, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA).
DNA fragments were resolved in agarose gels and purified using PCR
cleanup kit from the reaction mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) or excised from the agarose gel and purified using Zymoclean
gel purification kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) when required.
Circular templates were removed by applying DpnI enzyme restriction
according to the producer’s manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasmids were isolated from  cultures
using Sigma GenElute Plasmid kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).  transformations were performed using chemical
competent XL-1 Blue cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer instructions. Golden Gate Assembly
was performed as previously described using equimolar concentrations of 20 fmol for each fragment. For
a 10 μL reaction mixture 1 μL T4 DNA ligase buffer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 0.5 μL T7 DNA ligase (NEB New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, MA), and 0.5 μL of either FastDigest Eco31I (BsaI)
or BsmBI (NEB) were added. Gibson Assembly was performed using
Gibson Assembly Master Mix
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf All plasmids are reported in  and primers in . Watermarks were

calculated aswhere  represents each codon
substitution in a gene. Construction of Libraries Encoding Transcriptional
Units of
Watermarked Glycolysis http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf The sequences of the watermarked genes,
promoters (800 bp) and terminators (300 bp) were ordered from GeneArt
(Thermo Fisher, Regensburg, Germany). For compatibility with Golden
Gate Cloning, the sequences were ordered flanked with BsaI and BsmBI
restriction sites. The promoters and terminators were delivered by
GeneArt subcloned in the entry vector pUD565 and for the watermarked
genes the subcloning into pUD565 was done in house using BsmBI Golden
Gate cloning. An exception was made for , , , , and  which were amplified from genomic DNA of CEN.PK113–7D
using primers with flanks containing BsaI restriction sites listed
in . http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf Subsequently, the assembly
of the promoter, gene and terminator was done in the preassembled
vector pGGKd012 using Golden Gate cloning as described in the previous
section. pGGKd012 was assembled from the Yeast toolkit plasmids pYTK-002, 047, 072, 078, 081, and 083
(). Correct plasmid assembly
was verified by enzyme digestion with
either BsaI, BsmBI (New England Biolabs) or FastDigest enzymes (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Construction of gRNA Plasmids Used in the Study The
guide RNA (gRNA) plasmids pUDR413 and pUDR529 for the yeast strain
construction were designed and constructed according to Mans  (2015). gRNA targets
were selected using the Yeastriction tool in case of pUDR413, or designed manually for the  target in plasmid pUDR529. For pUDR413, the 2 μm
fragment was constructed in two parts using the primer 6131 and 5975
and primer 6296 together with 5941 using pROS12 as a template. For
pUDR529, the 2 μm fragment was obtained by PCR using primer
14549 and pROS12 as a template. The backbone for pUDR413 was amplified
with primers 6005 and 6006 using pROS13 as a template, while for pUDR529
same primer pair was used to amplify the backbone from pROS12. For
both plasmids, 100 ng of each purified fragment was used in the Gibson
Assembly and correct plasmid assembly was verified with the primers
3841, 5941, and 6070 in case of pUDR413 and 4034 and 5941 for pUDR529. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf The guide RNA plasmids for selective native copy gene removal of  and , named pUDR531 and pUDR532
respectively (), were constructed
as described in Mans  (2015) with the modifications regarding the design of the gRNA.
gRNAs were designed manually to target the native CDS containing a
PAM which was removed in the watermarked copy of the CDS. Each gRNA
was ordered as a primer (, primers
14515, 14517, 14519, 14521). The 2 μm fragment for four gRNA
plasmids was obtained by PCR using corresponding gRNA primer (, primers 14515, 14517, 14519, 14521)
and pROS13 as a template. The backbone for the four plasmids was obtained
by amplification with primers 6005 and 6006 using pROS12 as a template.
For the assembly, 100 ng of purified backbone and gRNA fragments were
used in the Gibson Assembly and correct plasmid assemblies were verified
with the primers 3841 and 5941 in combination with gRNA specific primers
listed in . Construction of SwYG Strains
with Native and Watermarked Glycolysis
and Double Glycolysis Strain http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf A schematic overview of the
strain construction approach is shown in . All yeast transformations were performed
according to Gietz and Woods (2002). For
highly efficient targeted integration CRISPR/Cas9 mediated editing
was applied. To this end, 350 ng of a plasmid carrying a corresponding
guide RNA (further gRNA) was transformed into the yeast strain together
with a purified PCR fragment (150 fmol) containing 60 bp homology
to the integration site and acting as donor DNA (see primers listed in ). gRNA plasmids and the donor DNA were specific for each strain
construction step and will be specified below. When donor DNA was
consisting of multiple fragments, 60 bp sequences for homologous recombination
(SHR) were flanking each of the fragments to enable  assembly by homologous recombination. PCR fragments for the native
SinLoG genes and for  and  were obtained using CEN.PK113–7D genomic DNA
as a template, while fragments encoding the watermarked SinLoG were
amplified from plasmids encoding the corresponding transcriptional
units (, ). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf To obtain a double auxotrophic host strain named
IMX1338, the  gene
previously inserted in the  locus of IMX589 containing
the SinLoG in chromosome IX was replaced
by the  expression cassette (p –  – t), which was amplified from the plasmid pUDC073 (primers 10708 and
10709). The replacement was mediated by a Cas9 gRNA plasmid assembled  from two PCR fragments amplified from the pMEL10
plasmid using primers 6005 and 6006 in combination with 10904 (gRNA
primer). Transformants were selected on SMG, and the gRNA plasmid
with  marker was removed by two sequential restreaks
on SMG with 5-FOA. The correct genotype was confirmed by diagnostic
PCR using primers 6190 + 1525 and 1553 + 6189 and later by whole genome
sequencing. To construct IMX1717 and IMX1747, IMX1338 was transformed
with the p426-SNR52p-gRNA.CAN1.Y-SUP4t plasmid targeting the  locus, and PCR fragments
of the 13 native or watermarked SinLoG glycolytic genes together with , , and the  marker gene (). Transformants were selected on SMG media and after strain confirmation
by PCR (, ) the gRNA plasmid encoding the  marker
was removed. As the next step, the SinLoG with variable length of
promoters and terminators was removed from the  locus in the strains IMX1717 and IMX1747. To this end, both strains
were transformed with plasmid pUDR413 and 1 μg of  repair fragment amplified with primers 13273 and 13274 introducing
homology flanks to the  site (). Transformants were selected
on SMG supplemented with G418 and after strain confirmation by PCR
using primers 11898 + 7479, 11898 + 2363, and 170 + 7479, the plasmid
was removed. For the construction of the strain IMX2028 containing
the native SinLoG in Ch V and watermarked SinLoG in Ch IX, first,
the intermediate strain IMX1748 was constructed by removing the  gene from IMX1771. This was done by transformation
with plasmid pUDR529 encoding a gRNA for the  gene and a repair fragment amplified with the primers 4223 and 4224
and containing homology to the  locus. Colonies
were selected on YPD media supplemented with Hygromycin B and correct
strain construction was confirmed by PCR using primers 4223 and 4224.
After  marker removal, IMX1748 was transformed
with plasmid pUDR314 and the mixture of fragments for the watermarked
SinLoG, , , and  marker gene resulting in strain IMX2028. Correct
assembly of the fragments was confirmed by PCR. Selective CRISPR/Cas9
Genome Editing http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf For selective
CRISR/Cas9 genome editing, IMX1717 () was transformed with 1 μg of a 120
bp repair fragment with homology to the beginning and end of the gene
and with 1 μg of plasmids pUDR531 or pUDR532 containing a gRNA
for  and  respectively as
described in the section Construction of gRNA plasmids and . Cells were plated on YPD with Hygromycin
B. Repair fragments (120 nt-long) and diagnostic primers are listed
in . Whole Genome Sequencing
and Data Analysis Yeast genomic
DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Genomic DNA Buffer Set and Genomic-tip
100/G tips (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
manual. The incubation step with zymolyase was performed for 11 h
and the incubation step for digestion with proteinase K was performed
overnight. The concentration of the genomic DNA mixture was measured
with the BR ds DNA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a Qubit
2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the purity was verified
with a Nanodrop 2000 UV–vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). IMX1770, IMX1771, and IMX2028 genomes were sequenced
on an Illumina MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using
the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 with 2 × 300 bp read length. Extracted
DNA was mechanically sheared to an aimed average size of 550 bp with
the M220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Wolburn, MA, USA). DNA libraries
were prepared using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Preparation Kit
(Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Quantification
of the libraries was done by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification
Kit for Illumina platforms (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA)
on a Rotor-Gene Q PCR cycler (Qiagen). The genome of CEN.PK113–7D,
the  constructed watermarked and reference
(native) SinLoG sequences and the  repair fragment
were used as a reference to map sequence reads of genomic DNA onto
using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA). The sequence alignment was further processed using SAMtools. Coverage of the sequence reads was also calculated
using the Magnolya algorithm. All
Illumina sequences are available at NCBI () under the bioproject accession number PRJNA554743. Batch Cultivations
of IMX1770, IMX1771, and IMX2028 Batch cultivations were
performed in biologically independent triplicates
in 2-Liter fermenters (Applikon, Delft, The Netherlands) with a working
volume of 1.4 L. Cells from exponentially growing SMG shake flask
cultures were inoculated into the fermenters containing SMG supplied
with 0.2 g·L antifoam Emulsion C (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO) at an OD660 of 0.4. The fermenters were sparged with
dried compressed air at a rate of 700 mL/min (Linde, Gas Benelux,
The Netherlands). The broth was stirred constantly at 800 rpm, kept
at a constant temperature of 30 °C and at a pH of 5 by automatic
addition of 2 M KOH by an Applikon ADI 1030 Bio Controller. Optical density was measured every hour at 660 nm with a Jenway 7200
spectrophotometer (Staffordshire, United Kingdom). For extracellular
metabolite analysis 1 mL of the broth was centrifuged for at least
10 min at 13 000 rpm and the supernatant was analyzed with
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Agilent 1100
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with an Aminex HPX-87H
ion-exchange column (BioRad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) operated
with 5 mM sulfuric acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.
The carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration in the gas outflow were
analyzed by a Rosemount NGA 2000 analyzer (Baar, Switzerland), after
cooling of the gas by a condenser (2 °C) and drying using a PermaPure
Dryer (model MD 110-8P-4; Inacom Instruments, Veenendaal, The Netherlands).
Biomass dry weight was measured 5–6 times by filtering (pore
size 0.45 μm, Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), as described
previously. Sampling for RNA was done
directly from the reactor in liquid nitrogen as described by Piper () The cells were stored
at −80 °C for maximally 2 weeks until further processing
and RNA was extracted as previously described. An equivalent of 48 mg dry weight per sample was used. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf At the same time points as the samples that were taken for RNA
isolation, approximately 62.5 mg dry weight was sampled for the enzyme
assays, stored at −20 °C in 4 mL aliquots and further
process as previously described. Optical
densities of the cultures at the moment of sampling for RNA analysis
and enzyme assays can be found in . Determination of  Enzyme Activities On the day of the enzyme assays, frozen samples were thawed and
prepared for assays as described by Postma () Assays were performed using a U-3010
spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokio, Japan) at 30 °C and 340 nm
as described by Jansen  (2005), with the exception of Pfk, which was performed
according to Cruz  (2012). Reported activities are based on at least two technical
replicates, measured with different cell extract concentrations. When
necessary, cell extracts were diluted in 100 mM monopotassium phosphate
buffer and with 2 mM magnesium chloride (pH 7.5), or in demineralized
water when triose phosphate isomerase activity was measured. The protein
concentration of the cell extracts was determined as described by
Lowry () using bovine
serum albumin as a standard. To evaluate the watermarking
methods, and to compare the markerQuant tool with traditional alignment,
we generated artificial RNA-Seq reads from the native and watermarked
sequences. Using the polyester R package, we simulated two conditions, in which the second condition has a
4-fold expression of each transcript compared to the first condition.
We used the standard  parameter of 0.005.
Generated reads were paired-end, each end 100 bp in length. RNA Sequencing
and Data Analysis RNA libraries and
sequencing were performed by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co.,
Ltd. (Yueng Long, Hong Kong). Sequencing was performed using HiSeq
150 bp paired-end reads system using 250–300 bp insert strand-specific
library. As described by Novogene, library preparation involved mRNA
enrichment using oligo (dT) beads, followed by random fragmentation
of the mRNA. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA using random hexamer primers
and a second strand synthesis was done applying a custom second strand
synthesis buffer (Illumina), dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I.
After adaptor ligation, double-stranded cDNA library was finalized
by size selection and PCR enrichment and samples were sequenced. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ Obtained data had an average of 23.08 M reads per sample (). To quantify the abundance of glycolytic
genes with and without watermarks, a similar scheme as the k-mer algorithm
of Gehrmann and co-workers was applied.
Briefly, for each transcript, we identify sequence markers of 21bp
that are unique in the transcript relative to the entire transcriptome
and genome. With an exact matching algorithm, these markers can uniquely
identify the transcript of origin of a read in RNA-Seq data. In contrast
to the previous work, we did not remove
overlapping markers (we did not remove redundant markers) but merged
them into larger sequences in which any 21 bp k-mer would uniquely
identify the transcript of origin. This allowed us to recover a higher
percentage of reads per transcript. Gaps in these merged sequences
that are not unique relative to the genome and transcriptome were
ignored in the marker quantification step. As in previous work, we
used an Aho-Corasick exact string-matching algorithm to quantify transcripts.
Differential expression was performed using DE-Seq2. All RNA-seq sequences are available at NCBI GEO () under GEO accession number: GSE135470. RNA Sequencing Data Analysis
Implementation and Code Availability https://github.com/thiesgehrmann/markerQuant https://github.com/thiesgehrmann/markerQuant The marker discovery
and quantification tools were developed ,
and the entire pipeline is implemented in python
using Snakemake. In addition to the k-mer
method, a traditional alignment pipeline is also implemented in the
markerQuant utility. All code, including an example data set, is available
at . Label Free Quantification (LFQ) by Shot-Gun Proteomics http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00045/suppl_file/sb0c00045_si_001.pdf For proteomics analysis, the
yeast strains pregrown to exponential phase in SMG in shake flask
were used to inoculate fresh SMG flasks. Five ml of these cultures
in midexponential phase were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 at 4 °C and the cell pellet was directly stored at
−80 °C. Cultures were performed in biological triplicates
for strains with watermarked and native glycolysis. To verify if the
difference in Gpm1 activity observed in bioreactor between the strains
with watermarked and native glycolysis was also present in shake flask
culture, Gpm1 activity was assayed in cell samples from the shake
flasks. This additional analysis confirmed the lower specific activity
of Gpm1 in the watermarked strain (). Protein Extraction and Trypsin Proteolytic Digestion Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer composed of 100 mM
TEAB containing 1% SDS and phosphatase/protease inhibitors. Yeast
cells were lysed by glass bead milling and thus shaken 10 times for
1 min with a bead beater alternated with 1 min rest on ice. Proteins
were reduced by addition of 5 mM DTT and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.
Subsequently, the proteins were alkylated for 60 min at room temperature
in the dark by addition of 50 mM acrylamide. Protein precipitation
was performed by addition of four volumes of ice-cold acetone (−20
°C) and proceeded for 1 h at −20 °C. The proteins
were solubilized using 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteolytic digestion
was performed by Trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), 1:100 enzyme to protein
ratio, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Solid phase extraction
was performed with an Oasis HLB 96-well μElution plate (Waters,
Milford, USA) to desalt the mixture. Eluates were dried using a SpeedVac
vacuum concentrator at 45 °C. Dried peptides were resuspended
in 3% ACN/0.01% TFA prior to MS-analysis to give an approximate concentration
of 250 ng per μL. An
aliquot corresponding
to approximately 250 ng protein digest was analyzed using an one-dimensional
shot-gun proteomics approach. Briefly,
the samples were analyzed using a nanoliquid-chromatography system
consisting of an EASY nano LC 1200, equipped with an Acclaim PepMap
RSLC RP C18 separation column (50 μm × 150 mm, 2 μm),
and an QE plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). The flow rate
was maintained at 350 nL/min over a linear gradient from 6% to 26%
solvent B over 45 min, followed by back equilibration to starting
conditions. Data were acquired from 5 to 60 min. Solvent A was HO containing 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B consisted of
80% acetonitrile in HO and 0.1% formic acid. The Orbitrap
was operated in data depended acquisition mode acquiring peptide signals
from 385 to 1250 / at 70 K resolution.
The top 10 signals were isolated at a window of 2.0 / and fragmented using a NCE of 28. Fragments were
acquired at 17 K resolution. Database Search, Label
Free Quantification, and Visualization Data were analyzed
against the proteome database from  (Uniprot, strain ATCC 204508/S288C, Tax ID: 559292,
July 2018) using PEAKS Studio X (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) allowing for 20 ppm parent ion and 0.02 / fragment ion mass error, 2 missed cleavages,
acrylamide as fixed and methionine oxidation and N/Q deamidation as
variable modifications. Peptide spectrum matches were filtered against
1% false discovery rates (FDR) and identifications with ≥2
unique peptides. Changes in protein abundances between both strains
IMX1770 and IMX1771 using the label free quantification (LFQ) option
provided by the PEAKS Q software tool (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.). Protein areas were normalized to the total ion
count (TIC) of the respective analysis run before performing pairwise
comparison between the above-mentioned strains. LFQ was performed
using protein identifications containing at least 2 unique peptides,
which peptide identifications were filtered against 1% FDR. The significance
method for evaluating the observed abundance changes was set to ANOVA.
The abundances of the glycolytic enzymes were further visualized as
bar graphs using Matlab2018b. The area of the biological triplicates
were averaged and standard deviations were represented as error bars. The mass spectrometry
proteomics
data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium () via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD016914..
