Nonribosomal peptides (NRP)
are a class of peptide secondary metabolites produced by filamentous
fungi and a subset of bacteria. NRPs are
synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which are
highly structured and complex enzymes, closely related to other modular
enzymes such as polyketide synthetases (PKS), NRPS-PKS hybrid synthetases,
and fatty acid synthetases (FAS). They have certain distinct properties
in common, the most striking one being their structural organization
in modules and domains, which reflects their shared evolutionary history. Typically, each module consists of an adenylation
(A), thiolation (T), and condensation (C) domain to select, activate,
transfer, and condensate a specific substrate amino acid, respectively.
In addition, modules can contain optional domains for substrate methylation,
epimerization, macrocyclization, and thioesterification, with the
latter being relevant for final nonribosomal peptide (NRP) product
release. Consequently, the structural
diversity of NRPs is tremendous. It has been estimated that about
500 naturally occurring amino acids and carboxylic acids may serve
as substrates for NRPS enzymes to form small bioactive peptide scaffolds. The natural functions of NRPs are as diverse as their structures.
They are involved in signaling, communication, metal ion chelation,
and host protection. NRPs have important pharmaceutical functions
as antibiotics, antifungal agents, immunosuppressants, as well as
cytostatic drugs. To facilitate the complex biochemistry of NRP formation in a cellular
environment, two types of activating and chaperoning factors for NRPS
have been reported in literature to date. -type
phosphopantetheinyl transferases (Pptases) activate both bacterial and fungal NRPS enzymes by phosphopantotheinylation
of the T domain active site. Typically, different
classes of Pptases exist with narrow and broad substrate specificities
and their corresponding genes are conserved in one or multiple genomic
copies across organisms. They are normally
not part of a secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC).
MbtH-like proteins (MLPs) are relatively small (below 10 kDa) and
associate with the adenylation domain of NRPS enzymes. Initially discovered in  as part of
the enterobactin BGC, MLPs were named
after the gene MbtH in the BGC encoding the iron-chelating siderophore
mycobactin (Mbt) in . It has become increasingly apparent that MLPs
play a key role in bacterial NRPS function. In bacteria, MLP genes can cluster with genes of
an NRP-coding BGC suggesting coexpression and specificity; however,
certain MLPs seem to be less specific and can interact with multiple
NRPS, presumably due to a generic, but not yet resolved
chaperoning effect. Upon binding, MLPs not only enable or enhance
the NRPS adenylation activity, but also
increase the solubility of NRPS enzymes, which are often the largest proteins in
bacteria. Despite the essential function MLPs fulfill for some bacterial
NRPSs, they appear completely absent from any fungal
genome sequenced up to date. Therefore, the introduction of MLPs in
a fungal host might increase the functional expression and activity
of fungal NRPS and possibly fungal NRP formation. Here, we have analyzed and tested five bacterial MLPs from various
bacterial sources to evaluate their impact on the activity of NRPS
enzymes in the filamentous fungus . This fungus is most prominently known as industrial producer of
β-lactam antibiotics, but in addition produces
various other secondary metabolites. Remarkably, three tested bacterial
MLPs stimulated the formation of nonribosomal peptides, showing improved
kinetics and elevated levels of secondary metabolites, including the
primary NRP products. This study shows for the first time that bacterial
MLPs can be utilized to enhance secondary metabolism in eukaryotes,
specifically a fungal host, providing a potentially new approach for
increasing the yield of fungal NRPs. Modeling of Conserved Residues for Interaction of Bacterial
MLPs and Fungal NRPS In order to explore the potential of
bacterial MLPs to interact with eukaryotic NRPSs, possible cocomplexes
were modeled. MLPs display a high degree of structural conservation, and several structures are available displaying
an A-domain–MLP interface: the NRPS SlgN1, involved in biosynthesis of Streptolydigin in  (ATCC 25470), EntF which produces
enterobactin in  (, strain JM109), the NRPS TioS from  in complex with its MLP TioT that is part of the thiocoraline BGC, and the dimodular NRPS DhbF in contact with
the clustered MLP ADP73024.1 from , producing bacillibactin. All structures
highlight the same potential interaction region, but the structure
of SlgN1 lacks an A domain and, in contrast to EntF,
possesses a covalently linked MLP. These observations suggest the
existence of a defined and conserved part of the A surface
which enables the dynamic association of different MLP variants. Therefore,
only the SlgN1 structure in complex with an MLP was used as a template
in the modeling. Furthermore, 5 MLPs were selected. Teg7 and
Veg8 stem from a metagenomic screen of soil bacteria, Tcp13 from  and CdaI and ComB are from . (). Adenylation domains were extracted from 3 NRPS enzymes
present in the filamentous fungus . These are the -δ-(α-aminoadipyl)--cysteinyl--valine synthetase ACVS (3 A-domains)
which synthesizes -δ-(α-aminoadipyl)--cysteinyl--valine (LLD-ACV), the tripeptide precursor
of penicillin; RoqA (2 A-domains), the NRPS synthesizing histidyltryptophanyl-diketopiperazine
(HTD), which is further converted into a series of roquefortine and
meleagrin derivatives and ChyA (2 A-domains), which is responsible for the formation of
2-(2-aminopropanamido)benzoic acid, which
is further converted into chrysogine. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf RaptorX and SWISS-MODEL served as a basis for the creation of  structural models of MLPs and A-domains and validated
against 23 PDB templates of 16 proteins (). Global Model Quality Estimates (GMQE, between
0–1) were calculated, resulting in a median GMQE of 0.62 ±
0.076 for A-domains and 0.76 ± 0.47 for MLPs (). The obtained models were structurally
aligned to SlgN1 (PDB: 4GR4) using PyMOL, both in a global and interface directed
fashion. Due to the absence of an A domain in 4GR4,
only the 340 A residues of SlgN1 were used for alignment,
covering the hypothetical A-domain–MLP interface. The process
allowed for an alignment of up to 305 (of 340) Cα carbons in
fungal-NRPS–SlgN1 models and 59 (of 61) in MLP–SlgN1
models, with low Root Mean Square Deviation errors (RMSD, ), indicating a structural
similarity. Next, A-domains and MLP sequences were aligned to the
corresponding templates and the secondary structure was extracted
from the model and compared (see a,b). Additionally, potential interface forming
(IF) and interactive (IA) residues were determined, according to the
SlgN1 structure. This accounted to 29 IF and 6 IA residues on the
MLP domain and 32 IF and 12 IA residues on the adenylation domain,
respectively. The alignment revealed that the selected MLPs displayed a high
count of 20 to 23 conserved IF residues (of 29) and are conserved
for all 6 IA residues (c). With respect to the fungal A-domains, 8–13 (of
32) IF and 4–10 (of 12) IA residues are conserved (d). The region resolving
around α-helix 11 and β-sheet 22 (in SlgN1 4GR4) on the
A-domain furthermore includes two core alanine residues at position
428 (A428) and 433 (A433), centered at the interface area. Although
A433 seems to be completely absent from all investigated fungal A-domains,
ACVS M2 and RoqA M2 both contain an alanine at position 428. Especially
the A-domain of ACVS M2 appears to have a high similarity to SlgN1.
With respect to the MLPs, not only the A428/A433 interacting partners
Ser23 and Lys24 are conserved, but all MLPs contain the minimal MLP
functionality motif (d). Overall, the MLPs structures are highly conserved and
are composed of 3 antiparallel β-sheets and one α-helix.
The most significant differences were found in the disordered N-terminus,
which is not involved in A-domain-MLP interactions. A more diverse
secondary structure topology was observed between fungal A-domains.
Although the upstream region of α-helix 11 appears reasonably
conserved, an additional short insertion (10 to 15 residues) is found
upstream of β-sheet 22 in all  A-domains tested here. However, this does not seem to interfere
with any hypothetical interacting residues as further underlined by
the high degree of structural agreement of the ACVS M2 A-domain and
ComB MLP with SlgN1 when superimposed (a). In spite of the absent A domain in SlgN1, the remaining analogous structures align well and
the local interface alignment reveals a good positioning of α-helix
11 and β-sheet 22 (b) at the core interface. In conjunction with the MLP
conservation and the very concise NRPS A-domain–SlgN1–MLP
superposition, this data indicated that also fungal NRPS are potentially
capable of interacting with bacterial MLPs Overview of MLP Variants Tested in
This Study putative (vancomycin-like

eDNA derived gene cluster, Teg cluster) MLPs were selected and characterized

Copurification of Bacterial MLPs with NRPS Enzymes http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf To validate the  predicted A-domain-MLP interaction,  copurification
experiments were attempted by coexpressing the cysteine-linking module
(M2) of the  NRPS ACVS in combination
with one of 5 different MLPs in . Because
of the poor expression of  ACVS
M2, modules of the functionally conserved bacterial ACVS from  were subsequently cloned and
tested because of the high degree of A-domain homology with the fungal
enzyme and no reported interactions with MLPs.  ACVS M2 could be expressed successfully in  along with one of the MLPs and was purified  a C-terminal added His-tag and visualized using SDS-PAGE. Despite
the considerable high level of MLP conservation, a distinct copurification
pattern emerged ( and ): ComB,
Teg7, and Tcp13 all copurified significantly with ACVS module 2 while
CdaI and Veg8 failed to copurify both with the ACVS module and the
full-length protein. This could imply that none of the 3 A-domains
presented to CdaI and Veg8 was accepted as an interaction partner,
possibly because of a more stringent specificity of CdaI and Veg8.
Strikingly, all five MLPs tested here do not show a high divergence
in their amino acid sequences nor any specific differences except
the variable C-terminus to explain the mechanisms shaping two classes
of interacting and noninteracting MLPs as observed here. A variation
of performance across similar MLPs was also observed by Schomer and
co-workers when testing MLP interactions
with the enterobactin NRPS EntF. It is important to note that the
coexpression of MLPs did not result in an improvement of soluble M2
and full length ACVS protein levels ( and ). This is in part expected since no ACVS containing BGC were
identified that contain an MLP. These data demonstrate that the ACVS
is indeed capable of interacting with MLP proteins, validating the
structural analysis. MLPs copurify with ACVS M2. ACVS module 2 (M2) from  and MLPs were coexpressed, and ACVS M2 was purified using the C-terminal
His-Tag. The NRPS module and the MLPs are indicated with
red arrows. The copurification pattern separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE
shows that ComB, Tcp13, and Teg7 can interact and show strong interactions
with the A-domain. M = marker; CFE = cell free extract; E = elution
fraction, 1:2 or 1:5 diluted. Bacterial MLPs Increase Titers of Fungal NRPS-Derived Products
in To examine the impact
of the bacterial MLPs on secondary metabolite formation in a fungal
host, 5 MLP candidates were transformed into  using appropriate expression cassettes and a nontargeted genome
insertion strategy.  strain DS17690
emerged from a classical strain improvement program (CSI) aimed to
optimize penicillin production and contains 8 copies of the penicillin
BGC, while strain DS47274 is derived from DS17690 but only contains
a single penicillin BGC. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf The presence of MLP variants in strains
was verified using colony PCR (). Strains were grown in submerged culture using medium supplemented
with phenylacetic acid for production of penicillin G. Culture supernatant
at day 2 and 5 was subjected to secondary metabolites profiling using
LC–MS. Subsequently, peak areas of final and intermediate metabolites
of the NRPS BGCs responsible for biosynthesis of penicillin (ACVS
– Pc21g21390), chrysogine (ChyA – Pc21g12630) and roquefortine
(RoqA – Pc21g15480) were quantified and normalized by dry weight.
LC–MS analysis of total ion chromatograms revealed major changes
in the extracellular metabolic profile of both  DS17690 and DS47274 borne MLP containing strains (). This concerned primarily products
of the chrysogine, penicillin and roquefortine BGCs but also other,
less well characterized compounds. Upon inspection of all combinations
of strains, peak areas of several compounds associated with the aforementioned
pathways significantly increased relative to the parental strains
lacking the MLPs (). We also obtained strains that showed lower NRPS product
levels, but this likely is a side effect of the nontargeted genomic
insertion strategy of the MLPs employ to generate the strains. A notable difference between the two strain backgrounds DS47274
and DS17690 was observed, showing overall stronger effects in the
lower penicillin producing DS47274 strains as compared to the high
yielding DS17690 strains. DS47274 strains expressing MLPs showed positive
effects on the penicillin, roquefortine and chrysogine biosynthesis,
while DS17690 borne strains experience the strongest effects on penicillin
derived metabolites. The stimulatory effect on NRPS products was also
observed for the initial, NRPS-derived metabolites LLD-ACV and HTD,
which are significantly increased in most of the DS47274 strains and
to a lesser degree in DS17690 strains. Increased levels of roquefortine-related
compounds were maintained on day 5 of cultivation, while the chrysogine-related
compounds, which were detectable after 2 days of fermentation were
less abundant on day 5 (). Overall, strains containing Tcp13, Teg and Com produced
an increased level of NRPS-derived metabolites while CdaI and Veg8
bearing strains did not show a significant change in NRPS products. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf Secondary metabolite formation by MLP strains. Different MLPs genes
were randomly integrated into the genome two  strain lineages, and changes of NRPS-derived extracellular metabolites
were quantified relative to the parental strain. Peaks were identified
according to accurate mass and retention time and normalized for dry
weight of the cultures. Strains are separated by their parental origin
(a) DS17690 and (b) DS47274 and day of fermentation. Each bar represents
the mean change of the peak area of a given metabolite relative to
the parental strain and was calculated from at least 3 independent
biological replicates, represented as (DS17690/DS47274): ComB (light
blue; 10/12), 12 Tcp13 (medium blue; 7/5), 10 Teg (dark blue; 6/4),
CdaI (brown; 4/6) and Veg8 (red; 5/3). Abbreviations of metabolites and acquired / values are included in . ComB MLP Performance for Production of LLD-ACV and HTD in http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf Strains derived from DS17690
(3) and DS47274 (5) carrying the ComB MLP were further characterized
for  and  gene copy numbers
as well as  expression at 2 and 5 days of the
fermentation (). All strains contained one copy of the  gene,
except for DS47274 7.1 and 8.1, which contain 5 and 8 copies of , respectively (b). Furthermore, DS47274 strains contain one copy of , while DS17690 strains contain 6–8 copies (a). The  expression profile of the selected strains 1.2; 2.4 (8x) and 7.3; 8.1 (1x), indicates that the gene
is well expressed after 2 and 5 days and that the expression increases
with the copy number (c). The strains were subjected to shake flask cultivation
and metabolite profiling (). Again, various secondary metabolites were affected,
in particular the penicillin and chrysogine related metabolites in
both DS17690 and DS47274 increased after 2 days, with the most pronounced
effect in DS47274. For roquefortine metabolites, levels increased
most pronounced in DS47274 strains after 5 days. The ComB-dependent
effect on penicillin production levels causes an earlier onset of
production, , after 2 days of fermentation, whereupon
it stabilizes to the levels found in the parental strain after 5 days.
A similar behavior is observed with the chrysogine related metabolites,
whereas the production of roquefortine-related compounds is stimulated
in the later stages of fermentation, , after
5 days ().
The levels of ACV were additionally quantified and corrected for cell
dry weight (CDW) (a). The RoqA derived product HTD increased up to 3.1- and
1.9-fold in strain DS47274 and DS17690, respectively (b). Extracellular levels increased
from 0.14 μmol/g(CDW) in DS47274 up to 0.70 in the DS47274 ComB
MLP strain 2–4_12 at day 2 and 0.61 to 1.48, in DS17690 and
DS17690 ComB MLP strain 2–4, respectively. All these observed
effects are not related to changes in expression of the NRPS enzymes
as indicated by the qPCR data. (). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf Characterization of gene expression and gene copy numbers in strains

each strain are shown in separate bars, derived from two biological

of ComB MLP A more controlled approach for integration was
performed in two other strain backgrounds, the penicillin-cluster
free strain DS68530 and DS68530res13, a strain where production of
the polyketide sorbicillin and related compounds was restored by reverting
a point mutation in the PKS gene  (Pc21g05080). The analysis now also included the fungisporin products of the 4-modular
noncanonical NRPS HcpA (Pc1604690). Fungisporin
and related cyclic tetrapeptides are only produced in trace amounts
when the penicillin BCG is present. In penicillin-cluster-free strains,
product formation is observed late in fermentation (after 5 days)
due to low  expression. In both strains, targeted, nuclease-stimulated integration of the ComB MLP construct into the
intergenic region between Pc20g07090
and Pc20g07100 was performed. Strains were purified and grown in penicillin
production media without phenylacetic acid and the levels of chrysogine,
roquefortine, fungisporine and sorbicillin related products were quantified
after 5 days and compared to the parental strains (). Again, an increase in metabolite
levels across all NRPS product classes was observed in DS68530 (a), but the pattern
differed when compared to the penicillin producing DS17690 and DS47274
strains. This can be explained by changes in primary metabolite availability
and altered NRPS gene expression when strains are grown in the absence
of phenylacetic acid. Remarkably, in the strain containing
the restored sorbicillin BCG, , DS68530res13,
ComB MLP had little effect on the production of NRPS-derived metabolites
(b). This strain,
however, in general shows only low levels of NRPs, likely because
the sorbicillin BGC competes for cellular resources for NRP production.
Taken together, these observations demonstrate that bacterial MLPs
stimulate NRP production in filamentous fungi. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf Impact of comB MLP on secondary metabolite level with targeted
integration in different strain backgrounds. Levels of chrysogin,
roquefortine, fungisporin and sorbicillin-related compounds in fermentation
broth were analyzed on day 5 of (a) DS68530 and (b) DS68530res13,
capable of producing sorbicillin and related compounds. Sorb1 = sorbicillinol;
Sorb2 = dihydrosorbicillinol; Sorb3 = dihydrobisvertinolone. Black
bars represent the average of the relative peak area, calculated from
3 individually purified clones (represented as red dots) against the
same number of individual parental strain cultures. Asterisks (*)
indicates a -value lower than 0.05 (2-sided Student’s  test). Abbreviations of metabolites and acquired / values are included in . This study demonstrates for the first time that expression of bacterial
MLPs can improve the biosynthesis of NRP-derived secondary metabolites
in filamentous fungi, as demonstrated for . Modeling of the MLP interaction with the A-domains of three fungal
NRPS suggests that many of the directly interacting residues are conserved
in the analyzed fungal A-domains. Indeed, elevated levels and improved
kinetics of NRP formation were observed when three different MLPs
were expressed in . Moreover,
the presence of ComB MLP increased the metabolite levels of four individual
NRP pathways, suggesting the existence of a transferable effect and
potentially low A-domain interaction stringency for ComB. However,
it was also observed that CdaI and Veg8 did not show any copurification
with the ACVS NRPS, pointing to a very stringent preference for A-domains.
Since the analysis of interacting amino acids in both MLP and NRPS
A-domains did not reveal any obvious bias between functional and none-functional
MLPs, further studies are needed to identify the underlying mechanism
separating these two groups. An interesting MLP to test in future
studies for their applicability in fungal hosts would be the MLP MXAN_3118
found in  DK1622. MXAN_3118 is not associated with a NRPS BGC but was found
to interact with seven different NRPS enzymes, making MXAN_3118 a
promising “universal” MLP. Despite different MLPs have
to be tried for a specific product, given their small size, all MLPs
can be incorporated with little effort and expression burden into
an eukaryotic screening or production host. Thus, MLPs provide an
interesting new tool for both native and heterologous BGC expression
in fungal strains or can be applied in biotechnological manufacturing
processes of NRP-derived metabolites. Furthermore, this MLP-dependent
effect could be of value for the discovery of NRPS derived cryptic
or low-abundance NRP metabolites with potentially relevant bioactivities. To establish a basis
for interaction probabilities of bacterial MLP and eukaryotic NRPS,
we utilized  ACV synthetase (PcbAB)
as a model NRPS and focused on interactions concerning the adenylation
domain (M2 A) of the second module. Adenylation domain boundaries
were determined using a prediction by the Conserved Domain Database
(CDD) of the NCBI. The obtained sequences
were subsequently used to generate models using RaptorX and SWISS-MODEL. Models were classified according to the Model quality (Global Model
Quality Estimation, GMQE) and were structurally aligned to SlgN1 (PDB: 4GR5) in a global and interface targeted fashion, respectively,
using PyMOL (Schrödinger, 2015). The resulting models were then used for superpositioning and visualization
in combination with 4GR4. Finally, a docking analysis was performed
using 3DIANA. In order to evaluate interactions,  ACVS was coexpressed with each MLP
variant separately. Therefore, the full length  ACVS gene as well as three DNA constructs encoding single ACVS modules
were generated, with domain and module borders being determined using
the Conserved Domain Database (CCD). Expression
of the proteins was performed using the  K12 derivative strain HM0079. Cells
were grown at 37 °C and 200 rpm to an OD = 0.6,
transferred to 18 °C, 200 rpm for 1 h and subsequently induced
using 0.2% -arabinose (pBAD–ACVS) and 0.3 mM IPTG
(pACYCtac–MLP). Cells were collected 18 h after induction by
spinning at 3500 for 15 min at 4 °C. After
resuspension in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM
DTT, complete EDTA free protease inhibitor; Roche, Basel, Switzerland),
cells were disrupted using sonication (6 s/15 s; on/off, 60 cycles,
10 μm amplitude) and cell-free lysate obtained by centrifugation
for 15 min 13 000 and 4 °C. Enzymes
were purified by means of His-tag affinity purification using Ni-NTA
beads (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). Wash steps were performed
using two column volumes wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl,
20 mM Imidazole) and a one-step elution using 5 bed volumes elution
buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole). Protein
concentrations were determined using the BioRad DC assay kit (BioRad,
Utrecht, The Netherlands). All fractions were analyzed on 5% SDS-PAGE
gels and stained using 0.025% colloidal Coomassie solution. Images
were acquired using a FUJIFILM LAS-4000 Scanner (Fujifilm, Tilburg,
The Netherlands). Protein levels were additionally compared in-gel
by 2-D densitometry using LAS-4000 AIDA software. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf strains

All parental strains used in this study,
genotypes, and integration sites of MLPs expression cassettes are
listed in . Cloning was performed using  DH5α. Plasmid selection was conducted
with 25 μg/mL Zeocin for pIAT and pBAD plasmids and 15 μg/mL
chloramphenicol for pACYCtac-MbtH (p15Aori; cat; pTac; lacIq), respectively.
All cultures were grown using 2xPY (15 g/L Bacto-tryptone, 10 g/L
Yeast extract, 10 g/L Sodium chloride, pH 7.0) at 37 °C and 200
rpm (New Bruinswick Innova 44R, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). MLP were derived from 4 different sources as indicated in . Genes were codon
optimized for , and ordered as
synthetic DNA (IDT, Leuven, Belgium). Subcloning into the pIAT or
pACYCtac vector was done using restriction with NdeI and NsiI. Assembled
constructs were sequence-verified using Sanger sequencing (Macrogen,
The Netherlands). The  ACVS gene
was kindly provided by DSM-Sinochem Pharmaceuticals B.V. For targeted integration of ComB MLP, the MoClo combinatorial cloning
system was used to build a final level
2 construct (pCP-ergA) by combining the Com expression
cassette from pACYCtac- and the squalene epoxidase  (Pc22g15550, expressed by the widely used  promoter from ) to confer resistance
to terbinafine as transcriptional units
TU1 and TU2, respectively. The obtained plasmid pCP--ergA served as a template for donor DNA amplification with 100bp-IGR-MoClo-FW
and 100bp-IGR-MoClo-R, adding 100 bp homology to facilitate integration
onto the intergenic region between Pc20g07090 and Pc20g07100. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf For initial transformations that introduced MLPs into , pIAT-MLP plasmids were cut with NotI
and I, recovered from gel, purified, and subsequently
concentrated by desalting. Protoplasts were prepared as described. Co-transformation was performed using the obtained
MLP expression cassette together with linearized pDONR221AMDS marker
vector in a ratio of 1:10. For targeted integrated of ComB MLP, donor
DNA was PCR-amplified from pCP--ergA with primer
IGR-FW and IGR-R, purified, and 4 μg were used for transformations.
To enhance homologous recombination into the accessible intergenic
region between Pc20g07090 and Pc20g07100, 3 sgRNAs ()
were used for formation of Cas9 ribonuclear protein particles as described
previously. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf After 5–7 days,
colonies were screened for integration of the MLP expression cassette
with primers (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) () targeting the IPNS
promoter and the AT terminator of each MLP expression cassette using
colony PCR (Phire Plant Direct PCR Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). Positive colonies were purified using
three sporulation-selection transfer cycles before rice batches for
storage and inoculation of shake-flasks were prepared. strains carrying the MLP genes were
subjected to shake-flask cultivation experiments for up to 5 days.
For preculture, spores stored on rice grains were inoculated in 25
mL YGG medium. After 24 h, the sporulated preculture was 10-fold diluted
in a total volume of 30 mL Penicillin production medium, which was supplemented with phenylacetic acid
(PAA) when the penicillin BGC was present in the strains to produce
penicillin G. All cultures were grown at 25 °C and 200 rpm under
semidark conditions in standard laboratory shakers (Innova44, New
Brunswick Scientific, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Sampling was performed
on day 2 and day 5 after preculture transfer by aseptically harvesting
2 mL of culture from the shake flask followed by centrifugation at
4 °C and 14 000 for 10 min to pellet
mycelium. From four strains expressing the MLP ComB, mycelium was
mixed with Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, The
Netherlands), transferred to screw-cap tubes containing glass beads
(0.75–1 mm, Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and
stored at −80 °C until analysis. The supernatant was subsequently
filtered using a 0.2 μM PTFE membrane syringe filter (VWR, Amsterdam,
The Netherlands) and stored at −80 °C up until analysis.
Samples were reduced using 10 mM TCEP prior to analysis. The remaining
volume of the culture after 5 days was additionally used for dry weight
determination. In all experiments two biological and two technical
replicates were used. qPCR Analysis of Gene Copy Number and NRPS Expression in MLP
Strains http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf Mycelium stored in Trizol was disrupted with a FastPrep
FP120 system (Qbiogene, Cedex, France). Total RNA was isolated from
aqueous phase by chloroform/Isopropanol isolation and purified using
the Ambion Turbo DNA free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk,
The Netherlands). RNA degradation was analyzed by electrophoresis
using a 2% agarose gel and concentrations were determined with a NanoDrop
ND 1000 (ISOGEN, Utrecht, The Netherlands). The iScript cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio Rad, The Netherlands) was used for reverse transcription
with 500 ng total RNA as input. The primers used for qPCR of Pc21g21390
(), Pc21g15480 (), Pc21g12630
(), and ComB are listed in (). The γ actin gene () was used as internal standard for data normalization.
SensiMix SYBR Hi ROX (Bioline Reagents, England) was used as master
mix for qPCR. All runs were performed on a MiniOpticon system (Bio
Rad) with two technical replicates per strain. The following conditions
were employed for amplification: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C
for 30 s, following an acquisition step. Raw ct data were exported
and analysis of relative gene expression was performed with the 2−ΔΔ method. The copy number
of  and the MLP homologue ComB was determined
from isolated genomic DNA of a selection of strains, following the
same protocols of qPCR as described above. For normalization and reference
point of single copy, γ actin was used. LC–MS Analysis and Evaluation of Metabolite Profiles http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00106/suppl_file/sb9b00106_si_001.pdf Clarified culture broth samples from fermentations were subjected
to LC-HRMS analysis. Analysis was performed by injecting 5 μL
sample on a C18 column (Shim-pack XR-ODS 2.2; 3.0 × 75 mm, Shimadzu,
Japan) coupled to a Orbitrap Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, The
Netherlands) operated in positive ionization mode. A gradient program
with water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 2% formic acid in water (C)
was run; 0 min; A 90%, B 5%, C 5%; 4 min, A 90%, B 5%, C 5%; 13 min,
A 0%, B 95%, C 5%; 16 min A 0%, B 95%, C 5%; 16 min, A 90%, B 5%,
C 5%; 20 min A 90%, B 5%, C 5% at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min. Two technical replicates were recorded for each sample. Available
standards were used to identify peaks according to retention time
and accurate mass. A complete list of all metabolites and intermediates
which were identified is summarized in ..
