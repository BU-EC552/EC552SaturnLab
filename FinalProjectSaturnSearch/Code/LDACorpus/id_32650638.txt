, as a “generally
regarded as safe” (GRAS) yeast, has been extensively engineered for the production
of oleochemicals, fuels, and commodity chemicals. The abundant acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
precursors in  have been harnessed
for synthesizing plant secondary metabolites in recent years, including
flavonoids, polyketides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and isoprenoids. A large collection of customized genetic toolkits, including Golden-gate
cloning, genome integration, CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 genome editing, transposons, auxotrophic markers, and promoter libraries have accelerated our ability
to perform targeted genetic manipulations. Different from ,  lacks Crabtree effects generating no overflowed metabolism toward
ethanol under high glucose conditions, which might be more suitable for high gravity fermentation and process
control.  is reported to valorize
a broad range of cheap and renewable feedstocks, including sugars, volatile fatty acids, alkanes, and municipal organic
wastes. This substrate flexibility provides us an environmentally
friendly approach to upgrade low-value carbons to high value chemicals
with reduced carbon footprint and improved process economics. Aromatic compounds have wide applications ranging from health care
to the food industry, nutraceutical supplements, and pharmaceutical
intermediates, which collectively represent a multibillion-dollar
global market. Although metabolically engineered  has achieved gram-per-liter levels of aromatic compounds, primarily
phenylpropanoids, yeast proves to be a more attractive
host, due to its GRAS status, robust cell growth, tolerance of harsh
conditions (such as low pH and high osmolarity), and the spatially
organized subcellular compartment for regio- or stereoactivity of
cytochrome P450 enzymes. Up to date, various metabolic
engineering strategies have been implemented in  and  to improve aromatics production,
including expression of the feedback-insensitive DAHP synthases and chorismite synthase, enhancing the shikimate
pathway and modular microbial coculture. A number of studies have been focused on optimizing the endogenous
Ehrlich pathway to produce 2-phenylethanol up to 3–6 g/L; however, the expensive precursor -phenylalanine was fed
into the biphasic bioreactors, restricting its economic
potential for large-scale production. The highest titer of 2-phenylethanol
production from the  shikimate pathway was
reported recently as 1.58 g/L (13 mM) from . There is a pressing need to explore
the metabolic potential of alternative yeast for aromatics production. In this work, we attempted to engineer the nonconventional oleaginous
yeast () as a competitive platform
host to produce aromatic derivatives (). With 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) as the testbed
molecule, we systematically characterized and removed the bottlenecks
of the endogenous shikimate pathway, resulting in the production of
2426.22 ± 48.33 mg/L (19.85 ± 0.40 mM) of 2-PE from glucose,
the highest titer ever reported from the  shikimate
pathway. Using this yeast as chassis, we further redirected the shikimate
flux toward other aromatics and achieved high titers of -coumaric acid (593.53 ± 28.75 mg/L), violacein (366.30 ±
28.99 mg/L, highest titer reported in yeast), and deoxyviolacein (55.12
± 2.81 mg/L, highest titer reported in yeast) in shaking flasks,
indicating the superior metabolic potential of  as an aromatics-producing host. This report highlights the prominent
metabolic characteristics of  as

Synthesis of 2-PE from Shikimate Pathway http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf In this work,
the  endogenous
metabolite 2-phenylethnol (2-PE, an aromatic alcohol that is widely
used as flavor and fragrance agent) was chosen as a target molecule
to determine the bottlenecks of the shikimate pathway. 2-PE synthesis
is a metabolic branch derived from shikimate pathway, in which 2-PE
is synthesized through four enzyme-dependent cascade reactions starting
from chorismate (a). To identify the potential limiting-steps in 2-PE synthesis, we
first systematically overexpressed all genes that are involved in
2-PE synthesis under the control of strong constitutive pTEF-intron
promoter, including genes  (, encoding phenylacetaldehyde reductase),  (, encoding phenylpyruvate
decarboxylase),  (, encoding prephenate dehydratase), and  (, encoding chorismate mutase). Besides gene , individual overexpression of genes , , and  did not result
in a significant increase in 2-PE titer (); however, combining all four genes (strain ) led the strain to produce 55.53 ± 0.85 mg/L of 2-PE
from glucose (),
a 6.55-fold increase in comparison with the control strain (without
any gene overexpression, 8.48 ± 0.50 mg/L), indicating that the
four enzymes in the Ehrlich pathway are essential to channel the carbon
flux toward 2-PE synthesis. In addition, chorismate mutase (ARO7)
is known to be strictly feedback inhibited by aromatic acids. To resolve this issue, introduction of a feedback-resistant
chorismate mutase ScARO7 originating from  further improved 2-PE production
up to 87.63 ± 4.67 mg/L (strain , b), which was consistent with
the previous report. We have configured
the Ehrlich pathway to achieve  2-PE synthesis
from glucose with enhanced titer. ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf We subsequently optimized the shikimate pathway
to unlock the potential
of  for production of aromatic
compounds. The entire Ehrlich pathway for 2-PE synthesis contains
multiple genes with total size more than 16 000 bp. To simplify the genetic manipulations, we integrated
the 2-PE pathway at the genomic  loci
(encoding acetyl-CoA hydrolase) with the integration plasmid pURLA-. The resultant strain  produced 50.13 ±
0.62 mg/L of 2-PE from glucose (b). In , shikimate
pathway is consisted of seven enzymatic steps, which starts from precursors
erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ends
up with chorismate (). By overexpressing genes  (, encoding pentafunctional aromatic protein),  (, encoding bifunctional
chorismate synthase),  (, encoding DAHP synthase),  (, encoding DAHP synthase), and  (, encoding DAHP synthase) in strain , we generated
strains , , , , and  that were able to produce 2-PE
with titers at 62.53 ± 1.28, 52.80 ± 2.18, 59.49 ±
1.70, 54.71 ± 0.87, and 57.16 ± 2.64 mg/L (), respectively. Strains , , and  showed slight increase
of 2-PE titer compared with strain . However, by simultaneous
overexpression of genes  and , 2-PE production was increased to 84.64 ± 4.42 mg/L (strain ).
Further overexpression of , , and  did not have a significant effect on
2-PE titer (strain , 78.28 mg/L, ), which is possibly due to the allosteric
regulation of DAHP synthase by aromatic amino acids, a common phenomenon
in . Validating and relieving bottlenecks in

Bottlenecks in the Shikimate Pathway Heterologous DAHP synthases
scARO4 (originating from ), AroG, and AroG (originating from ) previously have been shown to be feedback-resistant
of aromatic
amino acids regulation. We next introduced
three variants of the feedback-resistant DAHP synthases into the 2-PE
chassis strain, and generated strains , , and . Shake flask cultivation of strains , , and  led to the
production of 313.13 ± 10.16, 48.70 ± 5.92, and 430.11 ±
33.05 mg/L of 2-PE (a,b), respectively. This result clearly demonstrates that
overexpression of scARO4 and AroG are
effective to remove the shikimate pathway bottleneck in . Likewise, the results indicated the importance of relieving allosteric
regulation of DAHP synthase to increase carbon flux toward shikimate
pathway. ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 On the other hand, we sought to
eliminate the synthesis of aromatic
amino acids byproducts, including phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.
For this purpose, five genes (c) were chosen as knockout targets, including  (, encoding prephenate
dehydrogenase),  (, encoding anthranilate synthase),  (, encoding anthranilate synthase),  (, encoding aromatic amino acid aminotransferase),
and  (, encoding
aromatic amino acid aminotransferase). By sequentially deleting , , , , and  in strain
po1fk (which is Ku70-deficient), we got strains  (auxotroph
of tryptophan),  (auxotroph of tryptophan and tyrosine),
and  (auxotroph of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine).
Then the  2-PE pathway () was introduced into these auxotrophic
strains (YL18, 19, and 20), leading to strains YL21, YL22, and YL23.
In comparison to the parental strain  (87.63 ±
4.67 mg/L of 2-PE titer), strains , , and  led to 2-PE production (d) increased by 2.65-fold (231.84
± 1.46 mg/L), 3.49-fold (306.30 ± 43.57 mg/L), and 3.86-fold
(338.35 ± 26.41 mg/L), respectively, despite that negative effect
was observed in the cell growth. This result suggests that blocking
of aromatic amino acids formation may further relieve allosteric regulation
of DAHP synthase by -Phe, -Tyr, and -Trp, and simultaneously mitigate precursor competition. ylARO2-ylARO3-ylARO4-ylARO5-scARO4 ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 Taken
together, we have proved that introduction of feedback-resistant
heterologous DAHP synthases and blocking aromatic amino acids formation
are both effective to debottlenecking the shikimate pathway in . We next combined these two strategies
to boost the 2-PE yield. Genes encoding  and  were
sequentially integrated at genome loci of  and , to generate the chassis strain . By expression of the 2-PE pathway () in strain , the
engineered strain produced 508.58 ± 26.52 mg/L of 2-PE (strain , e), which was 1.18-fold, 1.50-fold, and 59.97-fold increase over
the , , and the starting strain , respectively. On the other hand, the operation
of shikimate pathway is driven
by the upstream precursors erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P, that is derived
from pentose phosphate pathway) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP, that
is derived from glycolysis). To further unlock the shikimate pathway,
we next turned to rewire the carbon flows in the central carbon metabolism
to optimize the supply of both E4P and PEP. Relieving bottlenecks in shikimate pathway. (a) The shikimate pathway

E4P http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf Metabolic flux analysis indicates that the available
carbon flux toward E4P is as least 1 order of magnitude lower than
the flux to PEP in yeast, which suggested
the availability of E4P is the key step to maximizing flux to shikimate
pathway. Overexpression of gene  (, encoding transketolase) improved 2-PE titer to 598.36 ± 0.46
mg/L (strain , ), a 1.18-fold increase over the strain . This result indicates that the supply of E4P indeed was a bottleneck. ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf In the pentose phosphate pathway, phosphoketolase splits fructose-6-phosphate
into E4P and acetyl-phosphate (a). In a recent
study, overexpression of heterologous phosphoketolase BbxfpK from  led to a 5.4-fold increase of intracellular
E4P concentration in . We therefore introduced the codon-optimized
phosphoketolase BbxfpK and AcxpkA (originating from ) into our yeast chassis to generate strains  and , respectively. However, we observed
declined 2-PE production () in both strains  (191.72 ± 7.97 mg/L
of 2PE) and  (146.76 ± 9.64 mg/L of 2PE). As
plasmids’ genetic instability (i.e., unequal distribution/propagation
of plasmid) was observed in our previous research, we speculated that
a similar effect was occurred in strains  and . To resolve this issue, linearized gene fragments (see ) containing pYLXP′-- and pYLXP′-- were integrated at the pBR docking site of strain , generating strains  and , respectively. As expected, shake flask cultivation of strains  and  led to a 133.64% (679.66 ±
1.14 mg/L) and 139.33% (708.58 ± 56.52 mg/L) improvement in 2-PE
titer (), compared
to the parental strain . This result clearly demonstrates
that manipulation of the phosphoketolase pathway is a feasible strategy
to channeling carbon flux toward E4P. After this, we integrated genes , , and  at 26s rDNA site in strain  with the helper plasmid
prDNAloxP--, obtaining
strain . However, expression of the 2-PE pathway
() in strain  gave almost same
amount of 2-PE (strain , 719.67 ± 51.14 mg/L, b) compared to strain . We speculate that the engineered yeast chassis has sufficient

equilibrium and further improve carbon flux
toward shikimate pathway, we moved to boost the precursor availability
of PEP. A previous study found that blocking
the reaction of PEP to pyruvate by deleting pyruvate kinase could
dramatically increase the intracellular pools of PEP. To validate
this strategy in , we attempted
to delete pyruvate kinase encoding gene  (). Reports found that yeast with pyruvate kinase
deficiency could not grow in the complete synthetic media (CSM) with
glucose as sole carbon source. To successfully
delete  () in YL31
background chassis, we replenished 0.5 g/L of acetate in the selective
CSM-plate (see ) to rescue
the growth phenotype and obtained stain . However,
strain  carrying the 2-PE pathway () showed a remarkable decrease in
both biomass and 2-PE production in the synthetic minimal media, even
with the feeding of acetate (stain , ).
Interestingly, when the same strain () was cultivated
in YPD medium with 5 g/L sodium acetate, we observed robust cell growth
( can also grow in YPD medium without acetate, as
shown in ). To this
end, we integrated the 2-PE pathways () into chassis  and cultivated YL33 with YPD medium containing 5 g/L sodium acetate
(YPA medium). The generated strain  significantly
improved 2-PE production to 1572.70 ± 67.82 mg/L in YPA medium
(c). The control
strain  (integration of 2-PE pathway  in strain ) produced
1252.41 ± 19.02 mg/L of 2-PE with YPA media under the same cultivation
conditions. This result confirmed that blocking PEP consumption by
deletion of  is a promising strategy for enlarging
flux toward shikimate pathway. Interestingly, the highest 2-PE
titer of strain  (1572.70 ± 67.82 mg/L) was
obtained at 72 h, and subsequently, 2-PE was gradually oxidized to
PEA (phenylacetic acid), which reached 1481.8 mg/L at 120 h (c). We speculate
that the metabolic bottleneck may be shifted from E4P/PEP to NADH
due to the exhaustion of glucose (d): the engineered cells need to oxidize
2-PE to generate NADH and maintain metabolite homeostasis. To resolve
this issue, feeding with 40 g/L of glucose effectively mitigated the
synthesis of PEA (e). As a result, we obtained a final 2-PE titer at 2426.22
± 48.33 mg/L (e). To further improve 2-PE titer, we next sought to eliminate
byproducts formation in strain  by knocking out , , and  (encoding aldehyde dehydrogenases), resulting in strains  and . Deletion of genes  and  (strain ) did not significantly
improve 2-PE production (2214.14 ± 26.48 mg/L, e), in addition, further deletion
of gene  (strain ) led to a
remarkable decrease in both cell growth and 2-PE production. This
is possibly due to the reversibility of  that
contributes to the reduction of PEA to 2-PE. In summary, we obtained the  platform strain  with optimized metabolic flux
toward the shikimate pathway. This chassis strain was validated for  production of 2-PE at 2426.22 ± 48.33 mg/L
(strain ), a 286-fold increase over the initial strain
(8.48 ± 0.50 mg/L). This is the highest 2-PE titer from the  pathway reported to date. To demonstrate the utility
of this 2-PE-producing platform, we turned to synthesize other aromatic-derived
compounds, including -coumaric acid (the derivative
of tyrosine), resveratrol (the derivatives of -coumaric
acid), and violacein (the derivative of tryptophan) in the following

extend the yeast chassis to produce other aromatic derivatives, namely -coumaric acid and violacein. -Coumaric
acid is the deamination product of tyrosine (a), which is the universal precursor in the
synthesis of flavonoids, aromatic polyketides, and lignin polyphenols. By simply overexpressing a codon-optimized tyrosine ammonia lyase  (originating from ) and  (that
has been deleted in the platform strain) in the yeast chassis , the resulting strain  produced 398.12
± 29.39 mg/L of -coumaric acid with glucose
supplementation (b). However, 994.02 ± 49.68 mg/L of 2-PE was detected, indicating
a strong competing flux from the endogenous Ehrlich pathway. Thus,
we next blocked 2-PE synthesis by deleting gene  (encoding prephenate dehydratase), the obtained strain  produced 593.53 ± 28.75 mg/L of -coumaric
acid with yield at 7.42 ± 0.36 mg/g glucose (b), a 1.49-fold increase compared
to the control strain. We further extend the -coumaric
acid pathway for resveratrol synthesis by introducing genes  (4-coumarate-CoA ligase from ) and  (resveratrol synthase
from ). Unexpected, only 12.67 (±2.23) mg/L of resveratrol was detected
in shake flasks (), indicating the existence of other rate-limiting precursors such
as malonyl-CoA in the chassis strain. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf Violacein is a naturally
occurring purple pigment with proven chemotherapeutic activity against
tumors and cancers. Both violacein and its derivate
deoxyviolacein have demonstrated a broad range of biological activities. By introducing violacein biosynthetic genes
(VioA, VioB, VioC, VioD, and VioE, c), we previously obtained violacein production
around 31 mg/L in . Surprisingly, overexpression of genes , , , , , , and  in
strain  led to the accumulation of black pigment
in the fermentation broth (). Violacein and deoxyviolacein reached 366.30 ± 28.99
mg/L and 55.12 ± 2.81 mg/L (d), which were 2.88-fold and 2.51-fold increase
over the control strain (, 126.99 ± 9.08 mg/L
of violacein and 21.98 ± 3.75 mg/L of deoxyviolacein) and 5.23-fold
and 10.44-fold higher than the production reported in our previous
work. To further improve the violacein
and deoxyviolacein production, we enhanced tryptophan availability
by overexpressing genes , , , , and . However, no significant improvements of violacein (348.43 ±
27.21 mg/L) and deoxyviolacein (58.21 ± 4.62 mg/L) titer were
observed in strain , suggesting that the supply of
tryptophan was sufficient in strain  and there might
be other limiting steps in the violacein pathway. Besides, we also
attempted to block the chorismite-competing pathway by deleting . No positive colonies were obtained in the background
of strain  with several attempts, but  could be deleted in po1fk. The specific reason for our inability
to delete  is not clear, which might be due
to the metabolic burden of violacein accumulated in the cell negatively
impacting cell fitness. However, the colonies with genome integration
of violacein pathway (po0fkV) in YPD plate showed that use of the
same promoters and terminators may lead to the occurrence of genetic
instability: a minor fraction of the restreaked colonies lost the
ability to produce violacein (). Thus, the frequency of using multiple identical promoters
and terminators should be minimized when integrating several genes
in one genome locus in . Interestingly, when the violacein-producing strain  was tested in the complete synthetic media (CSM-Leu), we obtained
less than 50% (180 mg/L) of violacein, compared to the violacein production
with YPD media (366.3 mg/L). We speculated that the presence of tryptophan
in the CSM-leu media (consisting of 50 mg/L tryptophan) might feedback
inhibit the expression of critical enzymes in the violacein biosynthetic
pathway. Switching to a CSM-Leu media with reduced tryptophan (20
mg/L) indeed improved violacein production to 271 mg/L, indicating
the presence or buildup of tryptophan strongly represses the enzyme
activity in the violacein pathway. The high violacein titer (366.3
mg/L) obtained in the YPD media might be due to the slow release of
tryptophan from yeast extract and peptone, which may not render feedback
inhibition effect on the violacein biosynthetic pathway. While exact
inhibition constants () of tryptophan
to critical enzymes in the violacein biosynthetic pathway will be
important for us to optimize amino acid composition in the CSM media,
the use of chromosomally integrated strain cultivated in YPD media
may bypass this feedback inhibition effect and improve aromatic compounds
production. Additionally, future investigations of strains , , and  should be performed
under
fed-batch cultivation with benchtop bioreactors and pilot-scale tests
to improve the titer, yield, and productivity of 2-PE, -coumaric acid, and violacein. Major bioprocess considerations should
be targeted at optimizing the culture medium, relieving 2-PE toxicity
and promoting cell fitness, as well as reducing the separation and
purification cost for 2-PE, -coumaric acid, and
violacein. Biphasic fermentation with end-product stripping might
be an effective way to remove product inhibition. Considering that
lignin is widely distributed in nature and it is made up with a variety
of aromatic monomers, coculture of  with lignin-degradation microbes, including  and ., with
solid-state or liquid cocultivation, might provide an attractive approach
to valorize lignin and produce other complex aromatic derivatives. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf In summary, by circumventing the intrinsic limitations of the endogenous
shikimate pathway, we successfully engineered an oleaginous yeast
chassis that produces 2426.22 ± 48.33 mg/L of 2-PE, 593.53 ±
28.75 mg/L of -coumaric acid, 366.30 ± 28.99
mg/L of violacein, and 55.12 ± 2.81 mg/L of deoxyviolacein. To
the best of our knowledge (), this result represents the highest 2-PE, violacein, and
deoxyviolacein titer from the  shikimate pathway.
This report highlights the prominent metabolic characteristics of  as chassis for production of various
aromatic derivatives. is an oleaginous yeast with
a superior metabolic capability to produce a large portfolio of fuels,
oleochemicals, and natural products. In this work, we systematically
overcame the rate-limiting steps of the endogenous shikimate pathway
and built a sustainable biorefinery chassis strain for  synthesis of aromatics. We determined that relieving
the feedback-inhibition of DAHP synthases is critical to channel flux
to shikimate pathway. We also demonstrated that eliminating byproduct
formation (-Phe, -Tyr, and -Trp) plays
an important role in mitigating the feedback regulation of DAHP synthase.
Overexpression of phosphoketolase and deletion of pyruvate kinase
provided a sustained metabolic source for E4P and PEP, which forms
the driving force to lead carbon flux through shikimate pathway. To
demonstrate the utility of our engineered  chassis strain, three natural products, 2-PE, -coumaric acid, and violacein, which were respectively derived from
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, were chosen to test the chassis
performance. With the engineered chassis , we obtained 2426.22 ± 48.33 mg/L of 2-PE, 593.53 ± 28.75
mg/L of -coumaric acid, 12.67 ± 2.23 mg/L of
resveratrol, 366.30 ± 28.99 mg/L of violacein, and 55.12 ±
2.81 mg/L of deoxyviolacein. These results highlight the metabolic
versatility of , and the native
shikimate pathway could be unlocked to produce a variety of aromatics
and natural products with economic values. Strains,

of engineered , including the genotypes,
recombinant plasmids, and primers have been listed in . Chemicals used
in this study were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Codon-optimized
heterologous synthetic genes, including genes , , , , and , were ordered from GENEWIZ (Suzhou,
China). Codon-optimization was performed with the IDT Web site. For performing shake flask
cultivations, seed culture was carried out in the shaking tube with
2 mL seed culture medium at 30 °C and 250 r.p.m. for 48 h. Then,
0.8 mL of seed culture was inoculated into the 250 mL flask containing
30 mL of fermentation medium and grown under the conditions of 30
°C and 250 r.p.m. for 120 h. One milliliter of cell suspension
was sampled every 24 h for OD, glucose, and desired
metabolism measurements. Seed culture medium used in this study
included the yeast complete synthetic media regular media (CSM, containing
glucose 20.0 g/L, yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate 1.7
g/L, ammonium sulfate 5.0 g/L, and CSM-Leu 0.74 g/L) and complex medium
(YPD, containing glucose 20.0 g/L, yeast extract 10.0 g/L, and peptone
20.0 g/L). Fermentation medium used in this study also included the
yeast complete synthetic media regular media (CSM, containing glucose
40.0 g/L, yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate 1.7 g/L, ammonium
sulfate 5.0 g/L, and CSM-Leu 0.74 g/L) and complex acetate medium
(YPA, containing glucose 40.0 g/L, yeast extract 10.0 g/L, peptone
20.0 g/L, and sodium acetate 5.0 g/L). Yeast Transformation and
Screening of High-Producing Strains http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf The standard protocols
of  transformation
by the lithium acetate method were described as previously reported. In brief, one milliliter cells was harvested during the exponential
growth phase (16–24 h) from 2 mL YPD medium (yeast extract
10 g/L, peptone 20 g/L, and glucose 20 g/L) in the 14 mL shake tube,
and washed twice with 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Then, cells
were resuspended in 105 μL transformation solution, containing
90 μL 50% PEG4000, 5 μL lithium acetate (2 M), 5 μL
boiled single stand DNA (salmon sperm, denatured) and 5 μL DNA
products (including 200–500 ng of plasmids, lined plasmids
or DNA fragments), and incubated at 39 °C for 1 h, then spread
on selected plates. It should be noted that the transformation mixtures
needed to be vortexed for 15 s every 15 min during the process of
39 °C incubation. The selected markers, including leucine, uracil,
and hygromycin, were used in this study. All engineering strains after
genetic manipulations were performed optimized screening by the shaking
tube cultivations, and the optimal strain was used to perform shaking
flask (these data have been shown in ). Single-Gene and Multigenes Expression Vectors
Construction In this work, the YaliBrick plasmid pYLXP′
was used as the
expression vector. The process of plasmid
constructions also has been reported. In brief, recombinant plasmids of pYLXP′- (a single gene) were built by Gibson Assembly of linearized pYLXP′
(digested by  and I) and
the appropriate PCR-amplified or synthetic DNA fragments. Multigenes
expression plasmids were constructed based on restriction enzyme subcloning
with the isocaudamers  and . All genes were respectively expressed by
the TEF promoter with intron sequence and XPR2 terminator, and the
modified DNA fragments and plasmids were sequenced by Quintarabio. A marker-free gene knockout method based
on Cre- recombination system was used as previously
reported. For performing gene knockout,
the upstream and downstream sequences (both 1000 bp) flanking the
deletion targets were PCR-amplified. These two fragments, the -- cassette
(digested from plasmid pYLXP′-l by  and ), and the gel-purified
plasmid backbone of pYLXP′ (linearized by  and ) were joined by Gibson Assembly, giving
the knockout plasmids pYLXP′--- ( is the
deletion target). Next, the knockout plasmids were sequence-verified
by Quintarabio. Then, the gene knockout cassettes were PCR-amplified
from the knockout plasmids pYLXP′---, and further transformed into . The positive transformants were determined
by colony PCR. Ku70 (Po 1f background) was knocked out by screening
more than 200 yeast colonies. Other knockout strains were built on
top of the Ku70-deficient strains. Subsequently, plasmid pYLXP′- was introduced into the positive transformants and promoted
the recombination of  sites, which recycle the
selected marker. Finally, the intracellular plasmid pYLXP′- was evicted by incubation at 30 °C in YPD media
for 48 h. Here,  is the uracil marker, and  is hygromycin marker. Specifically, for deletion of
gene , final concentration of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
2.5, 5 g/L acetate was added into the selective CSM-Ura plate to rescue
the cell growth. Besides integration of linearized plasmid, other
genomic manipulations in platform strain , including
gene knockout and integration of desired genes, hygromycin resistance
gene was used as the selective marker grown on YPD plate containing
200 mg/L hygromycin. Genomic Integration of Desired Genes http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00185/suppl_file/sb0c00185_si_001.pdf In this work,
genomic integration of desired genes were performed in two different
ways: site-specific genomic integration plasmids or application of
pBR docking platform by linearizing the plasmid pYLXP′ with
digested enzyme . Here, to meet specific requirements,
we constructed three genomic integration plasmids pURLK, pURLA, and
pHyLD, corresponding to the ,  (encoding acetyl-CoA hydrolase, named as Ace), and  (encoding lactate dehydrogenase, named as LDH) genomic sites, respectively.
The procedure of using these three plasmids was similar as that of
gene knockout protocol. Plasmid maps and sequences for pURLK, pURLA,
and pHyLD have been uploaded in the . Specifically, desired genes could be assembled
into pURLX based on restriction enzyme subcloning by using the multiple
cloning sites (see plasmid maps in  files),
and the integration cassettes of desired genes were retrieved by digesting
plasmid pURLX- with enzyme . Additionally, the standard protocol of 26s rDNA genomic integration
by plasmid prDNAloxP was used in this work, with detailed protocol
described in previous work. ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 ylPAR4-ylARO10-ylARO7-ylPHA2-scARO7 The
application of pBR docking platform was achieved by linearizing the
plasmid pYLXP′ with  restriction enzymes.
It should be noted that plasmids pYLXP′- and pYLXP′- have more than 2  digestion sites, and thus,
we performed site-directed mutagenesis to change the  site to  site in plasmid pYLXP′, generating
plasmid pYLXPs′. Subsequently, gene fragments in pYLXPs′-, pYLXPs′- and its derivates were linearized
by  digestion, and then the linearized fragments
were integrated at genomic pBR docking site. Quantification of Biomass,
Glucose, 2-PE, -Coumaric Acid, Resveratrol, Violacein,
and Deoxyviolacein Cell densities were monitored by measuring
the optical density at
600 nm (OD). The concentrations of 2-PE, phenylacetate,
glucose, -coumaric acid, resveratrol, violacein,
and deoxyviolacein were all measured by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) through Agilent HPLC 1220. In detail, 2-PE and penylacetate
were measured at 215 nm under 40 °C (column oven temperature)
with a mobile phase containing 50% (v/v) methanol in water at a flow
rate of 0.5 mL/min equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column
(4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent) and the VWD detector. The
concentrations of glucose were measured by a Supelcogel Carbohydrate
column (Sigma, USA) and a refractive index detector with HSO (5 mM) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min
at 40 °C. To quantify the concentration of -coumaric acid, 0.1 mL of fermentation culture was mixed with 9-fold
volume of absolute methanol (100% v/v), vortexed thoroughly, and centrifuged
at 12 000 r.p.m. for 10 min. The supernatants were analyzed
at 304 nm under 40 °C (column oven temperature) with a mobile
phase containing 45% (v/v) methanol in water at a flow rate of 0.5
mL/min equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (4.6 ×
100 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent) and the VWD detector. To quantify the
concentration of resveratrol, 0.25 mL of fermentation culture was
mixed with an equal volume of ethyl acetate and appropriate glass
beads, vortexed at 30 °C for 24 h, and centrifuged at 12 000
r.p.m. for 10 min. Then, 100 μL supernatants of top organic
layer was transferred to glass vial and evaporated to dryness, then
resolubilized with 100 μL of methanol. Resveratrol samples were
analyzed with the same HPLC protocols as -coumaric
acid. To quantify the concentration of violacein and deoxyviolacein,
0.20 mL of fermentation culture was mixed with 5-fold volume of ethyl
acetate and appropriate glass beads, vortexed at 30 °C for 24
h, and centrifuged at 12 000 r.p.m. for 10 min. The supernatants
of top organic layer were analyzed at 570 nm under 40 °C (column
oven temperature) with a gradient method with two solvents, water
(A) and methanol (B), at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min equipped with a
ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent)
and the VWD detector. The elution started with 100% of solvent A,
the fraction of solvent A was decreased linearly from 100% to 20%
(0–5 min), and maintained at 20% for 3 min (5–8 min),
then the fraction of solvent A was increased from 20% to 100% (8–12
min), and maintained at 100% for 1 min (12–13 min)..
