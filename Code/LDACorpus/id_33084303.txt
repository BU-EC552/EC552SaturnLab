Optogenetic
technologies, which
enable control of cell signaling and physiology through light, are
rapidly expanding in scope beyond initial restrictions to light sensitive
channelrhodopsins. Optogenetic approaches enable truly dynamic cellular
perturbation through spatiotemporally precise optical stimulation
techniques that can be finely tuned through modulation of light wavelength,
intensity, and frequency. Here, we report the development and initial
application of an optogenetic receptor system responsive to blue light,
enabling activation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling
pathway in the absence of a ligand in many cell types. BMPs
form part of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)
superfamily of signaling molecules: a group of structurally related
proteins that perform key cellular regulatory functions throughout
development and during tissue homeostasis. TGFβ molecules are dimeric when active and initiate signal
transduction through binding to a Type I or II receptor. Ligand binding
leads to the formation of a heterotetrameric signaling complex consisting
of two Type I and two Type II receptors that assemble depending upon
ligand specificity. In canonical signaling,
the TGFβ superfamily receptors recruit and activate receptor
(R)-SMAD proteins, defined by the presence of a short SSXS activation
motif which enables their interaction with Type I receptors. Despite close structural homology, TGFβ
superfamily receptors
are defined as TGFβ-like or BMP-like depending upon their interaction
with one of two R-SMAD groups; SMAD2/3 in TGFβ-like and SMAD1/5/8
in BMP-like signaling. Phosphorylated R-SMAD proteins form a complex
with SMAD4 facilitating their translocation to and accumulation within
the nucleus. R-SMAD–SMAD4 complexes bind directly to DNA where
they, in conjunction with other regulatory transcription factors,
control the expression of an extensive variety of genes despite the
relatively small number of upstream pathway components. In addition to SMAD-related canonical signaling,
both TGFβ and BMP receptor complexes recruit and activate a
variety of other intracellular signaling mediators. Noncanonical signaling,
primarily through various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),
contributes to the induction of specific TGFβ/BMP cellular responses
such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition, proliferation, and migration. The ability to elicit a diverse range of
cellular responses allows
TGFβ and BMP signals to have multiple roles in directing cell
fate during development, including the specification of germ layers
and subsequent specialization of a wide variety of cell types. Indeed,
many established directed differentiation protocols of human pluripotent
stem cells (hPSCs) require the activation or inhibition of TGFβ/BMP
signals throughout multiple stages to drive differentiation. However, control of the BMP signaling pathway is primarily limited
to the use of inconsistent and costly recombinant growth factors;
with synthetic small molecules not yet considered potent enough for
tissue engineering approaches. investigative and developmental models
primarily rely upon activation or inhibition of signaling pathways
to elicit a downstream cellular response; predominantly through the
use of soluble recombinant growth factors or synthetic chemical compounds
that mimic their activity. However, the use of stimulatory molecules
to investigate complex biological systems is limited by cellular receptor
expression and molecule instability. Furthermore,
the exogenous addition of stimulatory molecules, including growth
factors or small molecules, does not provide the fidelity or temporal
precision required for complex systems such as developmental models.
Biological tools that enable dynamic perturbation of cellular stimuli
can more precisely examine the interplay of signaling factors that
occurs within complex molecular networks. For example, technological
advances in microfluidic- and bioactive biomaterial-based approaches
have the capacity to provide increased control of signal inputs but
are still limited by their complexity and low throughput. Optogenetic approaches enable the use of light as a stimulus,
which
confers key advantages over traditional pharmacological manipulation,
including the flexibility of light illumination and dosage precision
in space and time. Although initial optogenetic approaches were limited
by the utility of light-sensitive channelrhodopsins, the discovery
and application of photoreceptor sensory domains with simple activation
mechanics have enabled the generation of more malleable optogenetic
tools. Commonly employed photoreceptors include
flavoprotein blue light response sensors and red light sensitive phytochromes. The light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) flavoprotein family of photoreceptors
is particularly attractive in photoreceptor engineering due to the
small size and the versatility of optogenetic manipulations. Optogenetic tools that utilize the LOV sensing
domain have been used to enable optical control of cellular signaling
pathways, gene expression regulation, and protein localization. Precise and fine control of TGFβ-superfamily molecules
has
focused upon TGFβ-like rather than BMP-like signals through
various means; including chemical-mediated dimerization of chimeric
receptors, sequestering and release of TGFβ ligands by biomaterials
and magnetic induction of TGFβ signaling. In addition,
several recent studies have described optogenetic induction of TGFβ-like
signaling, although induction of BMP-like
signaling has not yet been reported. The combination of factors described
above triggered us to develop an optogenetic BMP-like signaling system
as a cost-effective and high-throughput tool to dynamically perturb
the BMP signaling pathway. Development of an Inducible
Optogenetic BMP Signaling System http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf Activation of the canonical
BMP signaling cascade is controlled
by the tetramerization of Type I and II receptors in the presence
of an appropriate ligand. We hypothesized that BMP-like Type I and
II receptor heterodimerization would be sufficient to initiate signaling,
as previous work has indicated that TGFβ-like Type I and II
receptor dimerization can activate the canonical TGFβ-like SMAD2/3
signaling pathway. Therefore, we constructed two
optogenetic BMP-like receptors; optoBMPR1B and optoBMPR2 (A,B). We fused the
aureochrome1 light oxygen voltage (LOV) sensing domain derived from () with the
intracellular regions of both receptors at the C-terminal end and
anchored both to the plasma membrane with a myristoylation motif.
The  LOV sensing domain dimerizes upon
blue light stimulation; thus forcing the Type I and II receptors into
close proximity to initiate signal transduction (A). Such a strategy has previously
proven successful in the light-induced dimerization of TGFβ-like
nodal receptors and several receptor tyrosine kinases. We then incorporated both receptors into lentiviral doxycycline-inducible
vectors to enable transgenic genomic integration combined with temporal
control over receptor expression (). Development of opto-BMP system. (A) Schematic representation of
the optogenetic BMP (optoBMP) system. (B) Vector illustrations of
the (top) optogenetic BMP receptors and (bottom) SMAD1/5/8 response
element reporter (BRE). Optogenetic receptors were designed as follows:
the cytoplasmic region of either BMPR1B/ALK6 or BMPR2 was inserted
between a myristoylation signal peptide and the light oxygen voltage
(LOV) domain. A hemeagglutinin (HA) tag is located at the C-terminus.
Optogenetic receptors were then inserted into a doxycycline inducible
second generation lentiviral backbone vector with distinct fluorescent
protein markers. OptoBMP Can Be Used to
Modulate SMAD1/5/8 Transcriptional Kinetics http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf We initially
characterized activation of the optoBMP system in
HEK293T cells through analysis of real-time SMAD1/5/8 transcriptional
kinetics using a BMP-like response element reporter (BRE) (). After 24 h doxycycline treatment
to induce expression of the optoBMP system, optoBMP-HEK293T-BRE cells
were illuminated with blue light (470 nm, 0.25 mW/cm)
for 15 min. After 4 h, a significant, over 2-fold induction of the
BRE above prestimulation was observed in illuminated cells while cells
that were kept in the dark did not appear to respond (A). Optical BRE induction was
not significantly different from that obtained with BMP2. Furthermore,
we were able to correlate BRE response amplitude with variable light
irradiance, demonstrating the ability to fine-tune the optoBMP response
with blue light (B). Analysis of real-time SMAD1/5/8 transcriptional kinetics demonstrated
a unique light-driven response profile in comparison to BMP2-stimulated
controls (C).
BMP2 or light illumination resulted in a response peak after ∼4
h, but light illumination resulted in a significantly more rapid induction
of the BRE, as illustrated at 30 min after initial stimulation (D). To ensure the optoBMP system functioned
through BMP-like receptor
activation, we treated optoBMP-HEK293T-BRE cells with LDN193189; which
directly inhibits the kinase activity of BMP-like Type I receptors. Addition of LDN193189 at a low concentration
(5 nM) is sufficient to inhibit BMPR1A/ALK3 kinase activity but not
that of BMPR1B/ALK6, which we utilized in the design of the optoBMP
system. We observed significant BRE induction
in cells treated with 5 nM LDN193189 30 min after light illumination
in comparison to cells that remained in the dark (E). Upon application of 50
nM LDN193189, BRE induction was abolished, indicating that the optoBMP
system initiates canonical BMP-like signal transduction through light-induced
opto-BMPR1B kinase activity. Optogenetic activation of opto-BMPR1B
additionally requires the presence of opto-BMPR2, with neither receptor
functional when expressed individually (F). Thus, although light-induced LOV dimerization
may result in the formation of optogenetic receptor homodimers or
oligomers, the optoBMP system likely functions through transactivation
of Type I kinase activity by Type II receptors. Through targeting
the most upstream pathway components for optical
control, the optoBMP system almost entirely utilizes native cellular
machinery. As the binding of SMAD1/5/8 to transcriptional targets
are influenced and directed by cell-dependent expressed cofactors,
the design of the optoBMP system does not interfere with this process.
Currently available small molecule compounds that target the BMP pathway
subvert receptor activation and thus may disrupt or improperly engage
in additional recruitment of signaling effectors that bind to active
SMAD1/5/8. Therefore, the optoBMP system
has greater potential to investigate the roles of BMP signals in any
natural cellular context. As expression and activation of the optoBMP
system can be induced at any time upon doxycycline and light illumination,
respectively, the system subverts native cellular regulatory systems
driving the expression of specific receptors or the internalization
and degradation of ligand–receptor complexes. In addition, BMP ligands are promiscuous in their receptor
activation, and thus light illumination provides precise dosage and
downstream receptor specificity. Characterization of opto-BMP
system in optoBMP-HEK293T-BRE cells.

of optoBMP Drives a BMP-like Response
in a Chondrogenic Cell Line http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf To investigate the potential
of the optoBMP system in a relevant context, we transferred the system
into the immortalized chondrocyte cell line TC28a2 to test the response
in a skeletal model. BMP signals are
critical in chondrocyte and osteocyte development and maintenance. Optogenetic receptor expression (detected through
the tagged hemeagglutinin (HA) signal) was only seen in doxycycline
treated cells (A), confirming the doxycycline-dependent induction of optogenetic
receptor expression. We then investigated if activation of the optoBMP
system induced native SMAD1/5/8 signal transduction. Nuclear accumulation
of P-SMAD1/5 was analyzed 2 h after 15 min of blue light illumination
(B). Single
cell quantification of the mean nuclear intensity of P-SMAD1/5 indicated
a significant increase in comparison to controls that remained in
dark conditions (). P-SMAD1/5
nuclear intensity was observed to be higher in BMP2-treated controls
that were stimulated continuously for 2 h, but the percentage of positive
cells in both light and BMP2-stimulated conditions after 2 h was not
significantly different (C). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf We observed a small increase
in basal SMAD1/5/8 signaling upon
doxycycline addition in the absence of light, indicating a low level
of spontaneous optoBMP activation, most likely as a result of the
spatial proximity of receptors both expressed at the cell membrane.
Alternatively, or in combination, continuous doxycycline-driven receptor
expression may result in receptor excess. However, blue light illumination
resulted in significant enhancement of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and
induction of transcriptional activity in comparison to cells kept
in the dark. Although not an issue in this study, spontaneous optoBMP
activation without light may be eliminated through a similar approach
to that used by Li . in which one of the receptors is localized to the cytoplasm, hence
allowing signaling solely thorough light-activated membrane localization.
Supplementation of doxycycline, and therefore expression of the optoBMP
system, was required to enable blue-light induction of P-SMAD1/5 nuclear
accumulation. The blue light specificity of the optoBMP system was
then demonstrated by subjecting optoBMP-TC28a2 cells to variable light
wavelength stimulations (). There
was no significant difference in mean percentage of cells positive
for nuclear P-SMAD1/5 between cells left in the dark and cells illuminated
with red (670 nm) or green (560 nm) light (D). In addition, activation of the optoBMP
system with blue light did not induce TGFβ-like SMAD2 nuclear
translocation, demonstrating specificity in targeting the BMP signaling
arm of the TGFβ superfamily (). Snail Family Transcriptional Repressor 1 (SNAI1) To illustrate the ability of the optoBMP system to elicit
a BMP-like
transcriptional response in optoBMP-TC28a2 cells, we initially measured
the SMAD1/5/8 response through BRE induction. As with optoBMP-HEK293T
cells, we found that 15 min of blue light illumination resulted in
significant induction of a SMAD1/5/8 response after 4 h (E). We then investigated
whether BRE induction correlated with upregulation of direct BMP-pathway
target genes 4 h after blue light illumination. Blue light induction
of optoBMP resulted in significant upregulation of  (, ,  ()
and  which are all known to be downstream targets of SMAD1/5/8 (F). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf We then investigated whether activation of the optoBMP system
initiated
involvement of noncanonical signal transduction through MAPK. Phosphorylation
of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) did not appear to
be different between nonstimulated cells and those stimulated with
light or BMP2 (). However, light
illumination and BMP2 stimulation resulted in significant induction
of  (); which
is facilitated through BMP-activation of noncanonical p38 MAPK (). Additionally,
both light illumination and BMP2 stimulation induced a small but not
significant increase in  () expression, which has additionally been demonstrated
to be controlled through noncanonical BMP signals. expression, which can also be BMP-responsive
through noncanonical mediators, was not
significantly altered. Therefore, the optoBMP system has the capacity
to stimulate activation of both canonical and some noncanonical downstream
BMP targets in a comparable manner to that of BMP2 stimulation. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf Blue light illumination did not appear to result in upregulation
of known BMP response genes  or inhibitory , which acts as part of a negative feedback loop, both
of which are upregulated following BMP2 stimulation. The apparent differences between optoBMP- and BMP2 ligand-driven
responses may be a result of unique signaling receptor complexes.
The lack of native BMPR1B/ALK6 expression in TC28a2 cells indicates
that a BMP signaling response is driven through a BMPR1A/ALK3-BMPR2
receptor complex unlike the optoBMP system (). Although BMPR1B/ALK6 activation has been demonstrated
to result in  induction in several cell lines,
cellular context is known to be important in directing downstream
BMP signaling and therefore may not totally align with optogenetic
receptor complex activation in TC28a2 cells. Moreover, BMP2 stimulation used here involved 4 h of sustained signaling
in comparison to a short 15 min light-induced activation of the BMP
pathway. In future work we will aim to mimic BMP-ligand induced activation
through the use of longer durations of light illumination. Induction of a BMP-like response in chondrogenic optoBMP-TC28a2

of optoBMP in a Human Development Model As human embryonic
stem cells (hESCs) have proved a useful model
system for studying development to many different lineages, they are
a suitable system for testing optogenetic regulation of development.
To demonstrate the potential of the optoBMP system in this context
we transduced hESC line MAN13 with the
optoBMP system. We initially performed verification of pluripotency
through immunofluorescent staining of established pluripotent markers
OCT4 and NANOG (A). Then, to determine functionality of the optoBMP system in hESCs,
we analyzed nuclear accumulation of P-SMAD1/5 after blue light illumination
(B). Single
cell quantification of nuclear P-SMAD1/5 indicated significant induction
of the canonical BMP pathway when compared to cells kept in the dark
or stimulated with light in the absence of doxycycline (C). To further illustrate optogenetic
activation in hESCs we analyzed BMP target gene expression. Again
we observed significant upregulation of direct BMP target genes including , , and  after
optogenetic stimulation (D). Interestingly, several genes appeared upregulated
by light illumination and not by BMP2, including differentiation genes  and . As , , and  genes have crucial roles
during developmental processes, these preliminary data suggest that
the optoBMP system could be utilized in hPSC development models as
a substitute for recombinant growth factor supplementation. In this study we demonstrate that short light pulses are
sufficient
to alter BMP signaling using the optoBMP system. In the future it
will be interesting to investigate the effect of complex light stimulation
patterns and longer illumination periods, as used in several other
optogenetic studies. Complex cellular responses, such
as directing cell fate decisions and differentiation, often require
sustained and specifically timed stimulation, as illustrated by the
recent  application of an optogenetic Wnt
tool in hPSCs. In addition, the ability
to precisely manipulate the amplitude and spatial location of cell
signaling pathways can be used to investigate developmental signaling
networks . For example, recent studies in  and zebrafish have demonstrated
the utility of optogenetic tools in the investigation of embryonic
signaling dynamics. Furthermore,
the high-throughput nature and pathway specificity of optogenetic
approaches additionally lend themselves to live cell screens in drug
discovery pipelines and further dissection of signaling pathways. Given the involvement of BMP signals in both development and disease,
the optoBMP system can provide a powerful investigative tool in a
number of settings. The optoBMP system in its current form carries
some limitations.
The two engineered optogenetic receptors are currently incorporated
into individual expression vectors, thus it is difficult to simultaneously
express both in difficult-to-transfect cell lines. Random genomic
integration via lentiviral transduction may also result in early quiescence
or other growth abnormalities; particularly in clonal cell lines.
Modification of the optoBMP expression system through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
incorporation into genomic safe harbor locus AAVS1 would be useful
in the future to enable uniform and ubiquitous expression without
lentiviral transgene silencing; an issue which has been commonly reported
in the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. In summary,
we report the development of a novel optogenetic signaling
system that enables selective dose and time dependent control of BMP-like
signals through canonical SMAD1/5/8 and some noncanonical MAPK signal
transduction with blue light-sensitive BMP receptors. We demonstrate
that the optoBMP system can reliably recapitulate initiation of the
canonical BMP signaling cascade in several cell lines through phosphorylation
and nuclear translocation of SMAD1/5/8 leading to BMP-like transcriptional
activation, including upregulation of direct BMP gene targets. Extension
of the optogenetic toolkit to target the BMP pathway will provide
the means to dynamically probe BMP signals in a wide variety of systems. Optogenetic

Data information: Scale bars in panels A and B represent 100 μm.
Data presented in panel C represent mean values + SEM.  values were generated using an using an ordinary one-way ANOVA (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.0005, **** < 0.0001, ns =

NEB HiFi Assembly or restriction enzyme cloning. Both optogenetic
receptors were assembled through an initial generation of a vector
backbone through PCR amplification of opto-mFGFR (a gift from Harald
Janovjak, Addgene plasmid #58745) to omit the mFGFR coding region.
The intracellular coding regions of human BMPR1B/ALK6 (fully sequenced
cDNA clone from Source Bioscience; vector #IRATp970H1175D) and BMPR2
(Source Bioscience, #IRATp970B1178D) were then PCR amplified and inserted
into the vector backbone through NEB HiFi Assembly (New England Biolabs,
#E2621). Each optogenetic receptor was then subsequently inserted
into a second-generation lentiviral shuttle doxycycline inducible
vector through NEB HiFi Assembly. Briefly, vector inserts were generated
through PCR amplification of each optogenetic receptor with 30bp overhangs.
Vector backbones, pCDH-TRE3G-MCS-EF1a-tagRFP-T2A-TetON3G or pCDH-TRE3G-MCS-EF1a-tagBFP-T2A-TetON3G
for Type I or II receptor, respectively, were then digested with RI and vector inserts were annealed in through NEB HiFi
Assembly. Final lentiviral shuttle vectors were designated TetOn-optoBMPR1B
and TetOn-optoBMPR2. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00315/suppl_file/sb0c00315_si_001.pdf A modified version of a BMP reporter vector
previously described was constructed.
The BMP response element (BRE) consisted of multiple SMAD binding
elements arranged in tandem in forward and reverse orientations, placed
upstream of the AAV minimal late promoter. The BRE was cloned upstream of a destabilized form of NanoLuc Luciferase
(Promega) containing a C-terminal protein degradation sequence (PEST
sequence, NLucP). The completed BRE-NLucP was cloned into a modified
version of the lentiviral expression vector pCDH-EF1-T2A-copGFP, resulting
in the construct pCDH-BRE-nLUCP-EF1a-copGFP. Vector maps were generated
using Snapgene software (). HEK293T (ATCC, #CRL-11268), TC28a2 and SW1353 (ATCC, #HTB-94) cell lines were cultured
in 75 cm cell culture flasks (Corning) with DMEM (Gibco,
#11960044) containing 10% w/v fetal bovine serum (Merck, #12103C),
1% w/v -glutamine (Gibco, #25030081) and 1% w/v penicillin/streptomycin
(Gibco, #15140122). For routine maintenance, cells were subcultured
into flasks containing fresh warmed medium at a passage ratio of 1:10.
Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Merck,
#D8537) before cell dissociation with 3 mL of TryPLE Express solution
(Gibco, #12604021). Cells were then centrifuged at 700 for 3 min before pellet resuspension and continued passage. MAN13 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were cultured in 6-well plates (Corning) coated with 5 μg/mL
human recombinant vitronectin (Life Technologies, #A14700) in mTesR1
(StemCell Technologies, #5850) with medium replaced every 2 days.
For routine maintenance culture, cells were washed with PBS before
dissociation using 0.5 mM EDTA solution (Invitrogen, #15575-038).
Cells were centrifuged at 700 for 3 min before being
subcultured into fresh medium containing 1X RevitaCell Supplement
(Life Technologies, #A2644501). Lentiviral Particle Production
and Cell Line Generation All lentiviral particles were generated
through transfection of HEK293T
cells using calcium chloride precipitation. Briefly, HEK293T cells
were seeded in 15 cm dishes at 8 × 10 cells/dish 24 h before transfection with 9 μg of psPAX2, 6
μg of pMD2.G (VSV), 12 μg of shuttle plasmid (TetOn-optoBMPR1B,
TetOn-optoBMPR2, or pCDH-BRE-nLUCP-EF1a-copGFP) per dish. DNA was
added to 2.5 M CaCl before mixing with HEPES-buffered
saline (containing sodium chloride, HEPES acid, and disodium phosphate).
The calcium phosphate–DNA coprecipitate was then added dropwise
to cells. Medium containing lentiviral particles was collected over
48 h and concentrated at 6000 overnight at 4 °C.
The lentiviral pellet was then resuspended in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS
and was centrifuged in a high-speed SW40-Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter)
at 50 000 for 90 min at 4 °C. Finally,
the concentrated pellet was resuspended in 200 μL of ice-cold
PBS and stored at −80 °C. Viral titers were calculated
through serial dilution of viral preparations before transduction
of HEK293T cells and flow cytometry analysis of appropriate fluorescent
markers. HEK293T and TC28a2 cells were transduced with viral particles
at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) that did not exceed 20 IU/cell,
while MAN13 cells were transduced at an MOI that did not exceed 10
IU/cell before being sorted through FACS (BD FACS Aria Fusion). Optogenetic and Chemical Stimulation Prior to optical
stimulation experiments, all cell lines were seeded in black-walled
96 well plates at a density of 1 × 10 cells/well
or in black-walled 24 well plates at 5 × 10 cells/well
and were maintained in the dark after induction of optogenetic receptor
expression through 24 h incubation in serum-free medium containing
100 ng/mL doxycycline hyclate (Merck, #D9891). Optical stimulation
was performed at room temperature using either a custom-built Arduino-controlled
LED array device using 470 nm LEDs or
CoolLED pE4000 at 460 nm. Light irradiance was controlled through
a piece of custom software (LED array) or directly from the equipment
control panel (CoolLED). Light illumination was performed at 0.25
mW/cm for 15 min unless otherwise highlighted. Irradiance
was measured using a spectroradiometer (SpectroCAL MKII; Cambridge
Research Systems). Alongside optogenetic stimulation where noted,
cells were stimulated with 50 ng/mL BMP2 (R&D Systems, #355-GMP)
or 10 ng/mL TGFβ3 (Peprotech, 100-36E). Inhibition of the BMP
signaling pathway was achieved through addition of LDN193187 dihydrochloride
(Tocris, #6053) in combination with optical stimulation at concentrations
noted. Alongside LDN193187, cells were treated with DMSO vehicle control. Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System Optogenetic HEK293T
and TC28a2 cells were seeded in black-walled 96-well plates before
24 h serum starvation and induction of optogenetic receptor expression.
Extended NanoLuc luciferase substrate Vivazine (Promega, #N2580) was
added to live cells (dilution to 1X in serum-free DMEM) 2 h prior
to stimulations. After optogenetic or chemical stimulations were performed,
expression of NanoLuc luciferase was detected in an Alligator Luminescence
System (Cairn Research) using an appropriate exposure time (10–30
min). Bioluminescent micrographs taken over a period of time were
stacked using ImageJ software. A region of interest (ROI) was then
drawn around each well and relative luminescent units (RLU) were calculated
for each micrograph through Z-stack analysis. Luminescence was normalized
to background and to the luminescence value prior to the start of
stimulation. Immunocytochemistry and Imaging Cells were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and subsequently
washed in PBS three times. Fixed cells were then permeabilized and
blocked in 0.1% Triton-X (Merck, #9002-93-1), 10% donkey serum (DS)
(Merck, #D9663) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, before a further
three PBS washes. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (Cell
Signaling Technologies; #3724 HA tag 1:700 dilution, #9516 P-SMAD1/5
1:200 dilution, #5339 SMAD2 1:200 dilution, #2890 OCT4-A 1:200 dilution,
#4903 NANOG 1:200 dilution) in 1% DS in PBS at 4 °C overnight
before being subsequently washed three times in PBS. Cells were then
treated with AlexaFluor-488- or Alexa-Fluor-594-labeled secondary
antibodies (Life Technologies #A32790/#A32754, 1.200 dilution in PBS
1% DS) for 45 min at room temperature before a final three PBS washes.
Nuclei were visualized through staining with 10 μg/mL 4,6-diamindino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI - Life Technologies, #D1306) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature
followed by three washes in PBS. Fluorescent micrographs were taken
using a Zeiss Axioimager D2 upright microscope and captured using
a Coolsnap HQ2 camera (Photometrics) through micromanager software
v1.4.23. Image processing and quantification
was performed using ImageJ software. Nuclear quantification of P-SMAD1/5
was performed through an initial identification of nuclear outlines
through the DAPI channel (358 nm). This was achieved through the “Analyze
Particles” function of ImageJ after converting the image to
a binary output. Each nuclear outline identified by ImageJ was then
applied to the P-SMAD1/5 channel (488 nm) before using the ROI manager
to measure the mean gray value within each nuclear outline. Values
that fell 2×SD from the mean were omitted from analysis to eliminate
false positives or negatives. A threshold mean intensity value to
determine a positive P-SMAD1/5 response was calculated from analysis
of nonstimulated control images. RNA Extraction, Reverse
Transcription, and qPCR Analysis RNA extraction and purification
was performed using a Qiagen RNeasy
mini-kit (Qiagen, #74104) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, cells were dissociated and the cell pellet was resuspended
in 350 μL of RLT lysis buffer. Cell lysate was then subjected
to a series of on-column washes, after the addition of 350 μL
of 70% ethanol, before elution in nuclease-free water (Invitrogen,
#4387937). After quantification of RNA concentration, 2 μg of
RNA was converted to cDNA using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #4368813). qPCR reaction was then prepared
using PowerUp SYBR green master mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, #A25742)
with 10 ng of cDNA per reaction and 400 nM final concentration forward
and reverse primers. qPCR reaction was run using a BioRad C1000Touch
Thermal Cycler using the following cycling conditions: denaturation
at 95 °C for 10 min, 39 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C
for 30 s and 72 °C for 35 s, final extension at 72 °C for
10 min, and melt curve analysis at 65 °C for 5 s and 95 °C
for 30 s. Raw qPCR data were normalized to GAPDH using the 2 method. Primer sequences are listed in . List of Primer Sequences

Transgenes Optogenetic TC28a2 cells were seeded
in black-walled 24 well plates at 5 × 10 cells/well
before 24 h serum starvation and induction of optogenetic receptor
expression. Cells were then subjected to optogenetic or BMP2 stimulation
as described previously. Protein was harvested 2 h poststimulation
through briefly washing in PBS and lysing cells in 1X cell lysis buffer
with 6 μM Phenylmethanesulfonyl Fluoride (Cell Signaling Technologies,
#9803 and #8553). Briefly, cells were incubated on ice in lysis buffer
for 5 min before lysate was scraped into 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuged
at 14 000 at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant
was stored at −20 °C. Protein concentration was
measured using a Pierce BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23225)
before boiling 2 μg of protein at 95 °C for 10 min in lane
marker reducing buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #39000). Protein
samples were then subjected to gel electrophoresis at 100 V on a 10%
Bis-Tris gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #NW00100BOX) alongside broad
range markers (11–245 kDa, NEB P7712S). Protein was transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot-2 Gel Transfer and iBlot-2
Transfer stacks (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #IB21001 and #IB23001)
before blocking in 1X Tris buffered saline (TBS, Merck, #T5912) containing
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween (Merck, #P1379) for 1
h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated at 4 °C
overnight with primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies, #9102
ERK1/2, #4370 P-ERK1/2) in TBS containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-0.1%Tween),
before washing three times in TBS-0.1%Tween. Membranes were then treated
with secondary antibodies (1:15,000 IRDye 680RD Donkey anti-Rabbit;
LI-COR 925–68071) in TBS-0.1%Tween containing 5% BSA for 45
min at room temperature before a final three washes in TBS-0.1%Tween
and detection of protein using an Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR). Statistical Analyses and Figure Generation Figures
were generated using CorelDraw Graphics Suite or GraphPad Prism 8
software. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
8. Comparison between two groups were performed using an unpaired
two-tailed student’s -test and more than
two groups with an ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
subsequent Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. A  value of <0.05 was indicative of significance..
