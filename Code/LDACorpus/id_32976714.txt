Reconstituting
living cells
from their building blocks is one of the grand challenges in bottom-up
synthetic biology. To this end, much progress has been made in incorporating
complex cellular systems such as parts of the bacterial divisome, the oscillating Min system, synthetic signaling pathways, and cell-free gene expression systems inside lipid-based
vesicles. Cytomimetic protocells provide an ideal platform for improving
our capabilities to engineer ever more complex and integrated systems
with life-like properties. However, current protocell models fail to mimic the
physicochemical nature of the cytoplasm. The bacterial cytoplasm is
a highly crowded and heterogeneous mixture of proteins, nucleic acids,
and metabolites. With the intracellular macromolecular concentration
ranging between 200 and 300 mg/mL, the cytoplasmic conditions are
far from the dilute conditions typically employed in protocell experiments. Seminal experiments have shown glass-like dynamics in osmotically
compressed, or metabolically depleted cells. Crowded conditions, thus, are bound to have a significant impact
on the stability and mobility of macromolecular complexes, influencing
all aspects of intracellular chemistry. We, and others, have previously shown that macromolecular crowding
can indeed affect essential biochemical processes. However, previous  studies did not quite recapitulate the bacterial environment,
as crowding was typically achieved by the addition of synthetic polymers
with large excluded volumes such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
Ficoll. These polymers do not replicate the electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions that are present between protein surfaces and are thus
inaccurate mimics of the crowded cellular environment. We recently reported a microfluidic method
to produce and shrink
monodisperse liposomes by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in volume. These
shrunk liposomes are stable and capable of efficient protein expression. Here, we employ this method to systematically
increase crowding, achieving lysate concentrations up to 390 mg/mL.
First, we show how the diffusion of biologically relevant molecules
inside our liposomal protocells is dramatically affected not only
by crowding but also by enzymatic activity. We then studied the effect
of cytosolic crowding on gene expression. Surprisingly, gene expression
efficiency (i.e., the amount of protein produced from a fixed amount
of nutrients in the protocells) shows a highly nonlinear relationship
with the degree of macromolecular crowding. From our experimental
data, we build a mathematical model to determine the underlying reaction-versus-diffusion
kinetics that drive this nonlinear relationship. We find that macromolecular
crowding in protocells induces differential effects on transcription
and translation kinetics, and show for the first time a switch from
reaction-to-diffusion controlled kinetics at distinct macromolecular
crowding conditions for transcription and translation. This switch
has been theoretically postulated since the early 1990s. Yet, such a switch has thus far only been reported
for protein phosphorylation , and not for
more complex cellular processes. Together,
these results mandate future incorporation of the physical environment
in the design of synthetic cells. Using our previously reported method we prepared liposomes filled with cell lysate, feeding buffer (AAs,
NTPs, essential metabolites), salts (Mg-glutamate and K-glutamate)
and DNA (linear template) (A). These liposomes undergo partial dewetting, as can be seen in B (In the brightfield images, liposomes are
colored green, and oil droplets are colored cyan), allowing us to
osmotically shrink the liposomes by tuning the concentration of the
hypertonic (sucrose) solution outside the liposomes and the salt concentration
inside them. We shrank the liposomes to different extents, achieving
lysate concentrations ranging from 14 mg/mL to 390 mg/mL lysate. These
shrunk liposomes were stable for at least 18 h. Notably, shrinking
leads to not only increased lysate concentrations but also increased
concentrations of all other components, the importance of which we
will discuss in more detail below. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf The cytoplasm behaves like a dense, heterogeneous
colloid close
to its glass transition for large particles (30–40 nm) and like a liquid for small molecules such as
sugar and metabolites. We wished to ascertain
whether we can capture this aspect of the cytoplasm inside our protocells,
to determine if our system can mimic the crowded nature of the cytoplasm.
Therefore, we studied diffusion of relevant biomolecules of three
different sizes (0.34 kDa, 27 kDa, and 2.7 MDa) as a function of crowding.
We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to determine
diffusion coefficients of these biomolecules in protocells crowded
to different extents (A, ). As reported in the literature enzymatic
activity can significantly impact the state of the cytoplasm. To make
sure that we approximate the intracellular environment accurately,
we conducted diffusion measurements in the presence of cell-free expression
of cyan fluorescent protein (deCFP) (see ) inside the shrunk liposomes. Notably, the protein being expressed
was chosen to be different than the protein used for the diffusion
studies to decouple diffusion from enzymatic activity, i.e., gene
expression. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf We first studied the mobility of small molecules
using a fluorescent
analogue of glucose: 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose
(NBDG). FRAP measurements on NBDG were technically challenging at
low lysate concentration due to poor signal and rapid diffusion post/during
bleaching. However, NBDG was mobile, giving diffusion coefficients
>26 μm s even at lysate concentrations
exceeding 300 mg/mL, indicating that small molecules diffuse uninhibited,
with the effect of crowding being negligible (). Next, we studied diffusion of green fluorescent
protein (GFP) in crowded liposomes. With a molecular weight of about
27 kDa, GFP serves well for approximating diffusion of midsized proteins
in the cytoplasm. Diffusion coefficients of GFP decreased from 35
± 3.6 μm s to 1.8 ±
0.1 μm s () for increasingly crowded protocells (73–334
mg/mL), reaching similar values reported for  measurements of GFP diffusion in bacterial cytoplasm. Finally, we studied the properties of some of the largest complexes
in lysate, 70S ribosomes. Ribosomes were purified and labeled with Atto488 NHS ester dye. The diffusion coefficients
of ribosomes decreased significantly from 0.71 ± 0.05 μm s at 100 mg/mL to 0.077 ± 0.007
μm s at 240 mg/mL lysate concentration
(A, ). At a lysate concentration of 250
mg/mL, the ribosomes appeared essentially immobile, with the bleached
region not fully recovering fluorescence in 100 s. Calculating the
diffusion coefficient at 250 mg/mL based on an exponential fit to
the data yielded a value of 0.07 μm s. This is comparable with  measurements reporting
a diffusion coefficient of actively translating ribosomes of 0.04
μm s in  (. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf Above, we studied the change in diffusion as a function of
lysate
concentration for biomolecules of different sizes. These studies showed
that our protocells are indeed able to capture the size-dependent
diffusion of biomolecules observed in bacterial cytoplasm. However,
the bacterial cytoplasm has been observed to vitrify upon metabolic
depletion, thereby undergoing a liquid-like to solid-like transition
with respect to particle size. In ref (), Parry et al. compare
the cytoplasm to glass-forming liquids near a glass transition, wherein
large particles are trapped or caged by neighboring macromolecules.
Processes associated with metabolic activities collectively fluidize
the cytoplasm. Since our system captures the crowded nature of cytoplasm,
we aimed to explore the effect of metabolic (or enzymatic) activity
on diffusion. In addition, we note that Parry et al. achieved metabolic
depletion in bacterial cells by treatment
with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). DNP is a proton ionophore that rapidly
shuttles protons across the membrane. As a result, the intracellular
pH is bound to be affected. Changes in pH will in turn strongly influence
protein solubility and drive assembly of proteins, leading to gelation. Therefore, we also took into consideration the effect of pH in crowded
lysates. To that end, we studied diffusion of 70S ribosomes and GFP
in three conditions: in the presence of enzymatic activity; in the
absence of enzymatic activity but with buffered pH; and in the absence
of both enzymatic activity and pH buffer (). The presence of enzymatic activity was approximated
by  transcription translation (IVTT) (IVTT
in B,C,D).
Diffusion measurements with FRAP were conducted in the presence of
deCFP expression as mentioned above (see ). As shown in A, an IVTT reaction mixture consists of cell lysate, feeding buffer
(FB), and DNA template, with the FB consisting of energy elements
such as NTPs, amino acids, essential metabolites, and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) to maintain a pH around 8. To achieve the second condition,
i.e., absence of metabolic activity, but with pH buffer, we omitted
the FB, but added HEPES to buffer the pH at 8 (No FB, with HEPES in B,C,D). Finally,
the third condition, i.e. absence of both enzymatic activity and pH
buffer, was achieved by omitting both FB and HEPES (No FB, no HEPES
in B,C,D). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf Parry et al. observed that diffusion of particles decreased upon
metabolic depletion in a size-dependent manner. Diffusion coefficients of ribosomes noticeably decreased
upon metabolic depletion (B, No FB, with HEPES, ) ranging from 0.38 ± 0.02 to 0.047 ± 0.003 μm s for lysate concentrations 90–230
mg/mL. Moreover, a further decrease in diffusion coefficients was
observed in the absence of pH buffer (B, No FB, no HEPES, ). Yet, above a lysate concentration of 200 mg/mL, the difference
between these three regimes is no longer apparent. We performed a
similar set of experiments with GFP (C). Considering the size of GFP molecule
(∼3 nm, BNID 104396), we wanted
to test whether diffusion of GFP would be affected by metabolic depletion,
or in the absence of a pH buffer. A decrease in diffusion of GFP by
metabolic or buffer depletion was not immediately apparent, especially
at low crowding ([lysate] < 200 mg/mL) (). However, diffusion coefficients of GFP in the absence
of pH buffer were comparatively lower, at lysate concentrations above
200 mg/mL (). For a closer examination,
we calculated the effective viscosity experienced by GFP molecules
using the Stokes–Einstein equation (D; see , note on viscosity curves). We observed a slight increase in viscosity
upon metabolic depletion, and a dramatic increase in the absence of
pH buffer, at a lysate concentration exceeding 200 mg/mL. We hypothesize
that this large change originated from a change in pH in the lysate.
Using a ratiometric pH indicator dye (SNARF-5F 5-(and-6)-carboxylic
acid) we estimated the pH in the absence of HEPES to be around 6.37
(). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf We performed an additional
control experiment wherein we determined
diffusion coefficients, and thereby effective viscosity experienced
by GFP molecules, in the presence of HEPES buffered to pH 6 (). The  proteome
is known to be acidic, with the isoelectric point of most of the cytoplasmic
proteins being lower than 6. Proteins
close to their isoelectric points typically have low solubility, as
the low net charge results in weakened repulsive interactions. The
corresponding increase in the contribution of attractive interactions
drives the formation of protein assemblies. The absence of a pH buffer can thus lead to protein aggregation
explaining the observed increase in viscosity. Our system captures
the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm,
by displaying a particle-size dependent decrease in diffusion upon
metabolic depletion. Furthermore, we find that coupling metabolic
depletion with a reduction in pH further impairs diffusion. The size
dependence of these two conditions is also different, since metabolic
depletion impacts primarily large particles such as 70S ribosomes,
whereas the combined effect of metabolic depletion and lowered pH
exerts an influence on small particles like GFP as well. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf Having
established the cytomimetic nature of our protocell interior,
we wanted to gain insights into the efficiency of essential biochemical
processes in such crowded conditions. Therefore, we proceeded to study
gene expression in these protocells. To probe the impact of cytosolic
crowding on gene expression efficiency, we studied expression of deGFP under control of the endogenous σ70-specific
promotor p70a in crowded liposomes. Mg plays a diverse
role in gene expression, as it influences tRNA folding and ribosome assembly, and is a cofactor
for RNA polymerase. We therefore systematically
investigated the effect of different combinations of [Mg] and [lysate] on protein production in crowded protocells (see  and  for experimental details). We encapsulated the IVTT reaction mix
of varying initial [Mg] in liposomes and shrank (crowded)
them to different extents. We then determined the total amount of
deGFP expressed after 4 h, at room temperature. Interestingly, we
observe considerably different yields of deGFP at different levels
of macromolecular crowding (B), even though the absolute amount of starting material
(NTPs, AAs, metabolites, DNA, and cell lysate) was near-identical.
We also performed control experiments to verify that the variation
we observed in these experiments corresponds to the different amounts
of deGFP expressed (). The
different amounts of deGFP produced in these varying conditions, are
plotted in B as a function of the final concentrations of magnesium and lysate
(). Intriguingly, the level
of gene expression shows two optimal combinations detected around
lysate concentrations of 170 and 260 mg/mL, respectively. Notably, the second optimum occurs at a lysate concentration
that
is similar to the intracellular protein concentration for  (∼0.24 mg/mL, BNID 105938, 108263). The corresponding optimal [Mg]
is around 100 mM, which is far higher than the estimated concentration
of free Mg in  (around 1–2
mM). However, also in , the total concentration—including
bound Mg—has been reported as high as 100 mM (BNID 115774), and it is therefore likely that
most of the Mg is bound to nucleic acids or proteins.
Optimal expression at 100 mM Mg in our protocells could
also be explained by considering that shrinkage also increases the
concentration of NTPs, and increasing [NTP] and [Mg]
at the same time leads to stable transcription. Nevertheless, this does not explain the presence of two
maximum expression levels at different degrees of lysate crowding.
We must therefore consider that macromolecular crowding not only decreases
diffusion but also increases thermodynamic activities and association
constants, with the net effect of crowding
on a reaction being the result of these opposing mechanisms. Additionally,
transcription and translation are likely impacted at different levels
of crowding, due to the differences in size of the reactants involved
in each process. We thus expect translation
to be affected at a comparatively lower volume fraction than transcription,
as it involves larger molecular species such as ribosomes. To
better understand the effect of liposome shrinkage and [Mg] on transcription and translation kinetics we developed
a model that includes three effects: first, the differential effect
of macromolecular crowding on diffusion-controlled and reaction-controlled
rates; second, higher diffusion coefficients
for RNA polymerases (size 5–9 nm, BNID 114467) than ribosomes (size 21 nm, BNID 102320); and third, the previously observed effect of [Mg] on transcription efficiency (increasing [Mg] increases transcription efficiency,
yet after a certain maximum, further increasing [Mg]
inhibits transcription). Specifically, to incorporate the effect
of macromolecular crowding
on diffusion- and reaction-controlled rates, we used the formula previously
derived by Berezhovskii and Szabo. We
expressed transcription () and translation () rate constants as follows:where  are the diffusion coefficients for
RNA polymerase () and
ribosomes ();  are the respective contact
radii;  are the
rate constants in dilute conditions;
and  are the
respective finite potential well-depths resulting from the crowder-induced
interactions. As described by Berezhovskii and Szabo, is expected to increase and  decreases as a function of the degree of macromolecular crowding,
and the competition between these two effects determines the dependence
of the rate constant ( and ) on macromolecular
crowding. For the crowding-dependent diffusion coefficients
( and ), we used measured values of GFP and
ribosome diffusion
respectively (A). The GFP diffusion coefficients are an approximation for RNA polymerase,
since both GFP and RNA polymerases are in the same size range compared
to ribosomes (∼3–9 nm versus 21 nm respectively, BNID
104396, 114467, 102320). For the  we used the respective radii of RNA polymerase ( = 3.5 nm) and ribosomes ( = 10.5 nm). For  we used literature values in dilute conditions
( = 1092 nM h,  = 966 nM h), corrected
for the measured fold reduction in yield when performing cell-free
gene expression in bulk versus liposomes (see  section in ). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf Next, we incorporated
the dependence of macromolecular crowding
on the rate constants ( and ) into a set of coarse-grained
differential equations representing mRNA and protein production ( and ).Here,  and  are the
aforementioned production rate constants,  is a
scaling parameter representing the effect of magnesium on transcription,
and  represents the finite resources of the transcription
and translation machinery.  will deplete over
time as follows:where  is the depletion
rate constant, which for simplicity we assume
to be the same for transcription and translation machinery. To obtain
values for  and  we fit measured GFP expression in shrunk liposomes over
time at 250 mg/mL of lysate (A). At these high degrees of macromolecular crowding  approaches 0 (A) and  reduces toas previously described by Berezhovskii and
Szabo. We can thus fit our time-lapse
data to obtain  and
initial  (Root mean square error RMSE = 10.1).
We obtained  = 0.67
h, which is only marginally higher than previously
reported depletion rates of 0.05 h and 0.27 h for transcription and translation, respectively. Additionally, the fit yielded a starting value
for our resources  = 0.19; this value represents
the pool of limiting transcription and translation resources—i.e.,
polymerases, ribosomes, tRNAs, NTPs, amino acids, or other unknown
factors. Notably, obtaining two different  values
for transcription () and translation () did not improve the fit (, RMSE = 10.1), so we can assume  = . To verify our values, we quantified time-lapse measurements at
210 mg/mL of lysate (A) and compared the experimental data to our model predictions
under these crowding conditions. Notably, our model at 210 mg/mL (i.e.,
for slightly increased  and  compared to
250 mg/mL) accurately predicted the experimental data for these reduced
concentrations of macromolecular crowding (), indicating the accuracy of the fitted values for  and . http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf Next, to determine the dependency of  on macromolecular crowding, we compared
the model to experimental data for a range of macromolecular crowding
conditions. We varied the values for  ()
and  () independently, selecting values
for  that
best fit our experimental data (i.e., with the lowest RMSE, ) for the full range of macromolecular
crowded conditions (B, gray circles versus purple dashed line). As expected, for
both transcription and translation  increases
with increased crowding, and  >  since the attraction forces are larger for larger macromolecules
(). Once the values for  and  were obtained that best fit the experimental data (B), we could calculate transcription
and translation rates for the full range of macromolecular crowding
conditions. When comparing the reaction controlled regime (, C
and D black full line) with the diffusion controlled regime (4, C and D black dashed line), we can clearly see two distinct
transitions from reaction to diffusion control in the transcription
and translation rates—i.e., two distinct lysate concentrations
where transcription and translation rates are at their respective
maxima. For transcription, this transition occurs at 320 mg/mL (C) and for translation
this transition occurs at 133 mg/mL (D), explaining the two maxima observed in
the experimental data. NB: our model provides a rationale for the
two maxima observed, but does not show a pronounced local minimum
in between; future work will need to study the dependence of transcription
and translation rates on crowding in more detail. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf Finally, to
include the dependency of transcription on Mg into our
model, we fit a second-degree polynomial to gene expression
yields at varying Mg concentrations in dilute conditions
(). The polynomial describes
previously observed behavior, where the increased ratio of Mg compared to other transcriptional components enhances transcription
up to a defined maximum, after which Mg inhibits transcription
(see ,  for more details). When we incorporate this effect of Mg on gene expression
and plot final [Mg]—accounting for the increased
final [Mg] due to liposome shrinkage—versus macromolecular
crowding, the model accurately describes our experimental findings
(E). Notably,
the two maxima in protein yields are expected to be at different macromolecular
crowding conditions than the transitions from reaction to diffusion
control observed in transcription and translation rates, because the
protein yield is a result of the product of the transcription and
translation rates. Taken together, these data show that transcription
and translation perform most efficiently under different ideal macromolecular
crowding conditions and highlight the necessity to account for these
differential effects when designing synthetic cells. Schematic overview of the workflow. (A)

change in deGFP produced for different amounts of modeled macromolecular

liposomes is a robust method for cytomimetic compartmentalization,
with the interior of our protocells closely resembling the cytoplasm,
in terms of diffusion of macromolecules as well as metabolism-dependent
viscosity. We systematically studied the combined effect of [Mg] and macromolecular crowding on the efficiency of gene expression
in these protocells. We found that our experimental observations can
be explained by transcription and translation having differential
transitions from reaction-controlled to diffusion-controlled rates
with increasing macromolecular crowding. Our results represent a major
advance toward physiologically relevant protocells by accurately capturing
the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm. However, gene expression
in these cytomimetic liposomes is still not an accurate representation
of gene expression , which occurs from nucleoid
DNA. Considering the size of bacterial genomes and nucleoid-associated
proteins, the nucleoid plays a major role in crowding as well as localization
of mRNA and proteins. However, there are very few reports
on cell-free gene expression from genomic DNA. Future studies will address this gap by implementing cell-free
gene expression from isolated nucleoid DNA with endogenous transcription
and translation machinery. Further challenges will also include understanding
stochastic and spatial aspects of gene expression from nucleoid DNA
in crowded environments. The results reported in this work emphasize
the important role
the physical environment can play in cells. The crowded environment
clearly impacts different biochemical processes to varying extent,
depending on the size of the reactants involved. This raises interesting
new questions about how crowding affects cells during different parts
of their growth cycles as they undergo changes in volume. At a given
level of crowding, the efficiency of biochemical processes will be
governed by the size of the reactants and the corresponding effect
of crowding. Such a regulatory role of crowding also suggests subcompartmentalization
observed in eukaryotic cells as an evolutionary strategy, which enables
not only spatial separation of different processes but also confinement
of these processes at optimal crowding level. The different extent
of crowding in the nucleus (170–400 mg/mL) and the cytoplasm (∼100 mg/mL) in eukaryotic cells raises a fertile line of inquiry for
understanding how these cells form and function. For example, RNA
is often involved in the formation of membraneless organelles. The
relatively high macromolecular crowding could play a role in lowering
the critical concentration of RNA required for phase separation. Finally, our findings are of special interest for the efforts toward
building synthetic cells. As different biological modules are combined
for assembling synthetic cells, it will be important to consider the
size-dependent diffusion limitation that crowding will impose and
how it will affect the output as well as coordination of these different
modules. Imaging
and diffusion measurements
with FRAP were conducted on an Olympus Ix81 confocal microscope, equipped
with an Andor FRAPPA photobleach module and a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning
disk. 405 and 488 nm lasers were used to excite the samples. Images
were recorded with an Andor iXon3 EM-CCD camera. Images were acquired
at room temperature. A previously established protocol was used for
FRAP measurements. Briefly, a thin strip
in the middle of the liposome was bleached, and the recovery of fluorescence
intensity was recorded. The experimental recovery was fitted to predicted
recovery based on a 1D diffusion problem for fluorophore concentration
along the bleached strip. Uncertainties in the fit parameters were
estimated by calculating the change in log likelihood for a range
of parameter values around their fitted values and determining the
curvature of the resulting plot. The standard deviation was taken
as the point at which the log likelihood changed by one unit. A custom-made
routine in MATLAB was used for image analysis and data fitting. For FRAP measurements, we approximated metabolically active cytoplasm
by performing diffusion measurements in the presence of IVTT with
p70a deCFP. We chose CFP to avoid interference with FRAP measurements
(at 488 nm for NBDG and Atto488 labeled 70S ribosomes, and at 405
nm with GFP). The concentration of NBDG, GFP, and Atto-488 labeled
70S ribosomes used were 200 μM, 10 μM, and 0.21 μM
respectively. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf Supporting Information (Figures S2, S5–S7) Fabrication of microfluidic
devices for
making monodisperse double emulsion droplets was based on the procedure
outlined by Deng et al. and Utada et
al. Two cylindrical glass capillaries
of inner diameter 300 μm and outer diameter 1 mm (Hilgenberg)
were tapered using a capillary puller (PN-31, Narishige). The tapered
ends were then polished with sandpaper to achieve orifice sizes of
60–80 μm and 100–120 μm for the inner and
outer phase capillary, respectively. The inner phase capillary was
treated with trimethylsilyl chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) to render its
surface hydrophobic. This is especially important for encapsulation
of protein-rich mixtures. The capillaries were then arranged in a
coaxial manner inside a square capillary of inner diameter 1 mm (Vitrocom).
Fluids flow through the gaps between the cylindrical and square capillaries.
Dispensing needles were fixed at the junctions as inlets. The junctions
were then sealed with a two-component epoxy glue (Bison). Monodisperse
double emulsion droplets were generated by coaxial flow, as shown
in A. The outer
water phase, inner water phase, and middle oil phase consisted of
an aqueous solution with 15 wt % poly(vinyl alcohol) and 0.1% F-68
solution, IVTT reaction mix, and a mixture of chloroform and hexane
(40:60, v/v) containing 5–8 mg/mL -α-phosphatidylcholine
(egg PC), respectively. The double emulsion droplets were collected
on a glass slide inside a silicone isolation chamber (SecureSeal,
diameter 13 mm, height 0.12 mm). For osmotic shrinkage, 5 μL
hypertonic sucrose solution were added. The chamber was then sealed
with a coverslip for further observation. Additional details about
accuracy, and experimental procedure of microfluidic encapsulation
and osmotic shrinkage, are included in the . An IVTT reaction
mix consists, primarily of three
components: Cell lysate, feeding buffer, and DNA template. Cell lysate
and feeding buffer were prepared according to a protocol optimized
by Sun et al. and Caschera et al. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00330/suppl_file/sb0c00330_si_001.pdf BL21 Rosetta2 cells
were grown in 2xYT
medium, supplemented with 0.22 mM sodium phosphate monobasic and 40
mM sodium phosphate dibasic. The cells were grown until they reached
OD of 1.7 and then harvested by centrifugation. The
pellet was washed with S30A buffer (14 mM Mg-glutamate, 60 mM K-glutamate,
50 mM Tris, 2 mM DTT, pH 8.2 set with acetic acid). They were then
resuspended in S30A buffer of volume equal to 0.75 times the pellet
weight. The suspension was then passed through a cell press at a pressure
of 16 000 lb. The resulting extract was then spun down, and
the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. It was then dialyzed
in S30B buffer (14 mM Mg-glutamate, 150 mM K-glutamate, 1 mM DTT,
pH 8.2 set with 2 M Tris) and spun down. The supernatant was then
aliquoted, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80
°C. The protein content of lysate was determined using a Pierce
BCA assay (). The feeding buffer amounted to following
composition in the IVTT reaction mix: 50 mM HEPES (pH 8), 1.5 mM ATP
and GTP, 0.9 mM CTP and UTP, 1.5 mM each amino acid, except leucine
(1.25 mM), 30 mM 3-PGA, 0.26 mM CoA, 0.33 mM NAD, 0.068 mM folinic
acid, 0.75 mM cAMP, 0.2 mg/mL tRNA, and 1 mM spermidine. The components
were mixed, aliquoted, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored
at −80 °C. We also added  pyrophosphatase (final concentration 1U) (New England Biolabs) to
the reaction mix to avoid precipitation of Mg with inorganic
phosphate and keep it freely available in the solution. GamS was also
added to a final concentration of 1 μM, to prevent degradation
of linear DNA templates. DNA templates, corresponding
to p70a
deCFP and p70a deGFP sequences, were obtained from Arbor Biosciences.
PCR was performed using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New
England Biolabs), in a thermocycler using the manufacturers protocol.
The PCR products were purified using QIAGEN PCR purification kits,
and their concentration were determined with a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The concentration of linear DNA templates in IVTT
was 7 nM. Control experiments were
performed to establish the expression
activity of lysate in unshrunk liposomes compared to bulk, using 7
nM of p70a deGFP linear DNA template. These experiments yielded 14.5
nM and 1497.6 nM deGFP in unshrunk liposomes and in bulk, respectively.
Thus, for the final  we used literature values in dilute conditions ( = 1092 nM h,  = 966 nM h). This was corrected for the measured
