appropriately book open discussion struggle define synthetic biology field represented single breakthrough rather culmination approach knowledge made engineering design biological system tractable highlight new yet standardization part technique make engineering faster cheaper modular appeal scientist industrialist evident side also made manipulation biology approachable gained eye diyers well increasingly younger student entering research field international genetically engineered machine igem organization harnessed synthetic biology undergraduate population encouraging formation student team engineer build biological device competing one another world stage book aim fill current gap synthetic biology lack comprehensive laboratory manual beginning synthetic biologist manual provides many startup procedure scientific protocol necessary new lab heavily focus development synthetic biology lab course providing encompassing encyclopedic resource book start scratch laboratory setup supply safety provides introductory workflow common technique would definite use educator wanting bring synthetic biology classroom motivated undergraduate student desire start igem team moving second chapter manual cursorily cover many relevant scientific concept synthetic biology going detail choice reader introduced working bacterium dna method control gene output via transcriptional translational regulation includes solid discussion promoter ribosome binding site particularly useful resource new igem team member since element comprise large portion part stored dna registry team use use chromoproteins reporter output briefly mentioned small regulatory rna srnas described way repress gene expression topic mentioned herein conceptually useful chapter could benefitted organized discussion part available synthetic biologist may functionally assembled achieve target output system something briefly touched start chapter chapter address practicality setting lab space student equipment list synthetic biology thankfully long one manual includes photo illustrating key equipment couple tip usage equipment noted actual purpose basic working component machine never described information may seem basic lab student educator new lab information vital understanding experimental setup could nice addition working lab must never ignore safety first priority manual address response fire chemical spill ethidium bromide biosafety disposal dangerous equipment including gel electrophoresis setup centrifuge biosafety regulation briefly mentioned importantly lab manual cover biosafety level bsl1 project explains associated safety requirement reader must remember introduction institution associated safety biohazard chemical procedure beginning activity researcher trained certified personnel fifth chapter real focus effort describing depth week synthetic biology lab might structured clearly tailored toward instructor rather student author provide detailed list material well explicit timeline appendix truly making development course new institution achievable course smartly designed taking student experience hypothesis generation testing first experiment emphasizes importance making solution properly generating reagent approachable first step student never worked lab next course guide student prescribed activity must clone promoter front chromoprotein reporter motivation construction cloning scheme well described easy understand student led entire cloning workflow course experiment providing training many technique important synthetic biology pcr gel electrophoresis endonuclease digestion ligation transformation etc even though cloning step designed instructor student allowed creativity generating assay testing chromoprotein expression using skill learned developed early part course student become engineer alter expression chromoproteins student must independent research design change original construct help suggestion teaching strategy provided manual aid construction lab manual provides protocol instruction advanced cloning technique like pcr mutagenesis gibson assembly longer course particularly motivated student final lab section lab section experiment summarizes activity based previous igem project developed biobuilder material igem open source provide increasingly large library project material educator building synthetic biology course companion course design next section manual contains many common synthetic biology lab protocol cloning use useful section reader igem team working lab function independently rest lab manual resource student explaining experiment work glossed section however student instructor might look back chapter external resource mechanistic explanation technique assay advanced technical method introduced following chapter though protocol provided lab manual concludes section devoted starting igem team cleverly comparing starting pcr reaction logistical information appropriately left manual reader directed igem web site practical advice derived writer experience unique useful consulting previous igem member interested faculty well picking project author come prize winning igem program uppsala university sweden advice based year experience success synthetic biology lab manual overall excellent introduction genetic engineering technique geared toward instructor setting lab course functional igem team student starting field context igem competition might applicable general readership importance igem innovation development synthetic biology highlighted demonstrates good example successful design engineering biological device
