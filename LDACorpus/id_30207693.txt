Lysine acylation
is a posttranslational
modification (PTM) that involves the addition of an acyl group to
the epsilon-nitrogen of lysine residues. Of currently known acylations,
lysine acetylation—the posttranslational addition of an acetyl
(Ac) group—is probably the most prominent and best-studied,
primarily in the context of chromatin remodeling and regulation of
gene expression. That said, thousands
of potential lysine acetylation (as well as acylation) sites have
been identified in recent years, suggesting lysine acetylation to
be a widespread PTM affecting proteins involved in diverse, highly
regulated cellular processes (, cell cycle, splicing,
nuclear transport, apoptosis, metabolism, .). Lysine acetylation is carried out by a group of enzymes known as
lysine acetyltransferases, which catalyze the transfer of an acetyl
group from acetyl coenzyme A to a target lysine residue to form N-acetylated lysine (AcK, A, ). In humans, hydrolysis
of the acetyl group is carried out by a group of 18 enzymes known
as lysine deacetylases (KDACs). KDACs are generally divided into two
major families, the Zn-dependent histone deacetylases
(HDACs) and the NAD-dependent sirtuins (SIRTs). The former
can be inhibited by an array of inhibitors, such as suberanilohydroxamic
acid (SAHA), while the latter can be inhibited by nicotinamide (NAM).
The two enzyme families can be further divided into four classes,
based on sequence homology. Class I consists of HDACs 1, 2, 3 and
8, class IIa includes HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9, class IIb is made up of
HDACs 6 and 10, class III comprises SIRT1 through 7, while class IV
includes a sole member, HDAC11. It was also found that
some of these enzymes can act as deacylases, capable of catalyzing
 the hydrolysis of other acyl groups, such as propionyl (ProK, A, ), butyryl (ButK, ) and crotonyl groups (CroK, ). The increasing number of specific
acylated positions revealed in numerous proteins begs the question
of whether deacylation is part of a regulatory mechanism. If so, one
can then ask what determines KDAC specificity toward different substrates,
and to what degree different KDACs display cross-reactivity toward
different substrates. In this work we aim to provide an experimental
system that can be used to answer these questions. At present, a variety of techniques
and assays for detecting deacylation
activity (mainly deacetylation) exist, such as fluorometric, charcoal-binding
and NAM release assays. In these assays, deacylation is quantified by monitoring changes
in fluorescence upon deacylation of a fluorescent substrate, or by
monitoring a fluorogenic/chromogenic reaction between a deacylation
product and specific reagents. Although sufficient for detecting deacylation
and measuring KDAC kinetics , such assays
are not without their drawbacks; in particular, they require laborious
purification of the KDAC of interest, and, in many cases, can only
be used with short acylated peptide substrates (typically 5–15
amino acids long). Because only a peptide is used and not a folded,
full-length protein or domain, such assays may, however, offer limited
or even false insight into physiological KDAC-substrate interactions.
For example, the frequently used Fluor de Lys assay (BIOMOL/Enzo)
is based on monitoring the increase in fluorescence upon deacetylation
of a fluorogenic peptide substrate by a purified enzyme, . It has been argued that
in this assay, the conjugation of a small molecule to a short peptide
can affect the interaction between the studied KDAC and the peptide
substrate, so as to yield false negative/positive results. This can
have serious implications on drug screenings, for instance. For more informative studies in cultured mammalian cells, the use
of lines in which specific KDACs are deleted or knocked-down is usually
required, with acylation levels being then detected and quantitated
using different methods. Although such strategies are
more biologically relevant, they may still be affected by the
catalytic activity of different KDACs toward the same substrate
and might also be hindered by the acute phenotypic effects of deleting
certain KDACs. (A) Structure of acylated
lysine residues. N-acetyl--lysine (), N-propionyl--lysine (), N-butyryl--lysine (), N-crotonyl--lysine (). (B) Overview of mammalian deacylase activity
assay in transformed . Bacteria are incubated
in the presence of acylated amino acid (1), which is recognized by
an archeal aaRS capable of aminoacylating its cognate tRNA (PylT,
2). The aminoacylated tRNA (3) can suppress an in-frame TAG codon
(4) to allow cotranslational incorporation of the acylated lysine
residue. The C-terminal 6×His-tagged acylated substrate (5) is
coexpressed with one of the KDACs (6). If the acylated substrate is
recognized by the coexpressed KDAC, the acyl group will be hydrolyzed
in-cell during incubation (7). The level of acylation is then quantified
by Western blotting (8) as the ratio between anti-acyl-lysine and
anti-His immunoblot intensities. (C) Schematic representation of the
genetic components cloned in a modular three-plasmid-based system.
aaRS and PylT are constitutively expressed/transcribed, while expression
of a TAG mutant of the acylated substrate and the KDAC are induced
by isopropyl β--1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) or
lactose. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00314/suppl_file/sb8b00314_si_001.pdf To overcome
some of the obstacles researchers are currently faced
with when studying KDACs, we utilized genetic code expansion technology
and reconstituted mammalian KDAC-catalyzed reactions in  (, B). Genetic
code expansion technology enables the expression of full-length acylated
proteins by genetically encoding the site-specific incorporation of
exogenously supplemented noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into ribosomally
expressed proteins. The ncAA is usually encoded by an in-frame stop codon (, the TAG 'amber' codon) and cotranslationally incorporated
into a nascent poly peptide chain by an orthogonal pair of an
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its cognate suppressor tRNA. We reasoned that catalytic deacylation activity can be evaluated
by coexpressing a single KDAC with a putative acylated substrate.
In this approach, the KDAC and its potential substrate are coincubated
in the bacterial cell, with the level of substrate acylation being
subsequently evaluated by Western blot analysis using anti-acyl-lysine
antibodies (B). In , deacetylation is predominantly
catalyzed by CobB, a promiscuous, NAD-dependent enzyme
homologous to the SIRT family. Other potential deacetylases
expressed in  are LpxC and YcgC. However,
the former catalyzes the deacetylation of UDP-3--(acyl)--acetylglucosamine, whereas the latter
has disputable deacetylase activity. Therefore, to avoid
potential cross-reactivity with the principal endogenous deacetylase,
a CobB deletion (Δ)  BL21(DE3) strain was first generated using the  type II CRISPR-Cas9 system (). In this  mutant strain, NAM is not required for inhibiting CobB, making it
suitable for studying the catalytic activity of introduced NAD-dependent sirtuins. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00314/suppl_file/sb8b00314_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00314/suppl_file/sb8b00314_si_001.pdf For
the coexpression of mammalian KDACs and their putative acylated
substrates, we designed a modular expression system based on three
cotransformed plasmids (C). In our system, two plasmids carry all the required genetic
components for expression of an acylated substrate, namely pyrrolysine
amber suppressor tRNA (PylT), evolved or wild-type pyrrolysine aminoacyl
synthetase (PylRS), and a potential substrate harboring a specific
in-frame TAG mutation (encoding the ncAA). The KDAC under study is
encoded on a third plasmid, thereby enabling a “mix-and-match”
approach for studying different KDACs with different substrates. All
mammalian KDACs were cloned into pACYC-Duet vector, bearing a C-terminal
FLAG tag (). KDAC expression in
Δ BL21(DE3) cells was verified
by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibodies (). For those KDACs that were not expressed, truncated forms
containing the catalytic domain were designed based on previous studies,
and their expression was validated (hereafter, truncated KDACs are
indicated by an asterisk). Expression of full-length SIRT7 was achieved by fusion
to an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) for improved solubility,
as the truncated variant was not expressed as a soluble and/or active
enzyme. Protein expression was primarily
carried out in defined lactose-based autoinduction (AI) media, which
does not require active monitoring of culture density and induction,
thus facilitating the study of several KDACs in parallel. Additionally, density-based self-induction of
protein expression, as in AI media, allows for reliable comparison
of different samples and a high degree of reproducibility. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00314/suppl_file/sb8b00314_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00314/suppl_file/sb8b00314_si_001.pdf In
evaluating our system, we first confirmed that the introduced
KDACs were catalytically active in bacteria. To this end, we studied
the deacetylation of ∼15 residue-long acetylated peptides,
fused to the N-terminal of MBP bearing a C-terminal 6×His tag
(). Specifically, we considered
Lys9-acetylated histone 3 (H3 AcK9)- and Lys310-acetylated RelA (RelA
AcK310)-derived peptides, with the acetylated proteins being known
substrates of several KDACs. Indeed, acetylation plays an important role in the regulation of
these proteins. Histone 3 K9-acetylation is recognized as a major
epigenetic PTM that has been linked to various cellular processes
and diseases, such as telomere maintenance, neural differentiation,
and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, among others. RelA, the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), functions
as a transcription factor that mediates important immune and inflammatory
responses, and requires acetylation of Lys310 for full transcriptional
activity. Thus, the cloned KDACs were coexpressed
with different acetylated peptide substrates. Substrate acetylation
levels were estimated from Western blot performed with specific antibodies
against the acetylated residue. Expression of full-length substrates
was ncAA-dependent (), therefore,
the C-terminal 6×His tag was used for quantifying the expression
levels of the acetylated substrates. As control, the same substrates
were expressed without a KDAC (, with an empty
pACYC vector) under identical conditions. The catalytic activity of
the coexpressed KDACs was inferred from the ratio between the level
of acetylation (, anti-AcK immunoblot intensity)
and substrate expression levels (, the anti-6×His
immunoblot intensity). Results were normalized to the control measurement. In our evaluation, the mammalian NAD-dependent sirtuins
displayed significant deacetylase activity in bacteria when coexpressed
with H3 AcK9 peptide (A), apart from SIRT4*, which is known to present ADP-ribosyltransferase
activity and little to no deacetylase activity. When the cloned Zn-dependent HDACs were coexpressed
with the same substrate, only HDAC6* and HDAC8 were capable of catalyzing
the hydrolysis of the attached acetyl group. No significant catalytic
activity was observed for the remaining HDACs, even when tested with
known substrates (data not shown). We therefore reasoned that in comparison
to mammalian Zn-dependent HDACs, mammalian sirtuins are
considerably more active in bacteria, due to their higher degree of
homology to CobB. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00314/suppl_file/sb8b00314_si_001.pdf The catalytic activity of mammalian KDACs is often dependent
on
PTMs, and may also depend on the formation of complexes with other
factors. For example, nuclear receptor
corepressor 2 (NCOR2), a transcriptional coregulatory protein, is
known to facilitate the catalytic activity of HDAC3. Thus, NCOR2 (residues 395–489) was cloned into the
same vector containing HDAC3, and the two proteins were coexpressed
with an array of peptide substrates, including those derived from
known substrates of HDAC3, such as Lys18-acetylated histone 3 (H3
AcK18). However, HDAC3 showed no catalytic
activity toward any substrate tested when coexpressed with NCOR2 in
Δ cells (). Taken together, a total of eight mammalian KDACs expressed in
Δ cells (six sirtuins and two HDACs) demonstrated
deacetylase activity. This experimental setup enables semiquantitative
assessment of relative deacetylation level of different substrates
by a given KDAC, and qualitative comparison between the eight KDACs. When these eight catalytically active KDACs were coexpressed with
RelA AcK310 peptide, SIRT6 showed no significant catalytic deacetylase
activity and SIRT7 displayed marginal activity (B), demonstrating the selectivity of mammalian
KDACs expressed in bacteria. In addition, the catalytic activity of
the mammalian KDACs could be inhibited by known histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACi) in a concentration-dependent manner (). The catalytic activity of
mammalian SIRT1 coexpressed with H3 AcK9 peptide was inhibited at
NAM concentrations above 5 mM (A), while inhibition of HDAC8 by SAHA was observed
at concentrations above 10 nM (B). This range of SAHA concentrations is higher than
that used with cultured mammalian cells, possibly due to the limited
uptake of hydroxamic acid-containing molecules by . These data show that our approach provides
a method for evaluating the inhibitory effects of potential HDACi,
which have emerged as a novel group of drugs with potent anti-cancer
function. After verifying deacetylase activity of mammalian
KDACs expressed
in , we employed our experimental setup
to measure the deacylase (rather than deacetylase) activity of certain
mammalian sirtuins. It was previously shown that acylated lysine derivatives – can be incorporated into proteins
by wild-type and evolved pyrrolysine synthetase. Thus, as a proof of concept for the applicability and scope of our
methodology, H3 peptides containing different acyl groups on Lys9
(H3 ProK9, H3 ButK9, and H3 CroK9) were coexpressed with mammalian
KDACs in Δ cells. H3 K9 butyrylation and
crotonylation were shown to occur , but all three modifications have been identified on histones, and
their deacylation was previously studied  using K9-acylated peptides. Using anti-H3 AcK9
antibodies capable of recognizing other K9 acylations, we monitored
the acylation levels of the modified substrates coexpressed with SIRT1–3
or SIRT6, which are known to hydrolyze acylated lysine residues. The crotonyl group on Lys9 of the H3 peptide was hydrolyzed in the
Δ cells by SIRT2 and SIRT3, and to some
extent by SIRT1, but not by SIRT6. In contrast, the propionyl and
butyryl groups were hydrolyzed by the four coexpressed sirtuins (). These results
thus demonstrate that, similar to deacetylation, mammalian KDACs expressed
in  show deacylase activity, which can
be monitored using our experimental system. Following our analysis of short
acylated peptide substrates, we
next considered acylated proteins or domains. These considerably longer
proteins are more biologically relevant substrates, and also more
difficult to study by other methods. To allow comparison with the
deacetylation of Lys310-acetylated RelA peptide, we coexpressed the
eight active KDACs together with a truncated form of Lys310-acetylated
RelA (trRelA AcK310, residues 1–323) harboring the functional
Rel homology domain, which is essential for  dimerization and DNA binding, and can be expressed in bacteria as
a soluble and folded protein (A). The majority of KDACs
coexpressed with trRelA AcK310 demonstrated the same deacetylation
level as seen with the Lys310-acetylated RelA peptide (compare B and A). However, SIRT6 was able to recognize and deacetylate trRelA
AcK310, yet demonstrated no significant catalytic activity toward
the short substrate. In addition, SIRT7 could not hydrolyze the acetyl
group of trRelA AcK310 but displayed residual (yet significant) catalytic
activity toward the acetylated RelA-derived peptide. These results
highlight the advantage of performing deacetylation assays using fully
folded and acylated substrates and stress the importance of protein-protein
interactions that are not confined to the active site of the enzyme.
Importantly, we ensured that catalytic activities, or lack of them,
were independent of the ratio between the coexpressed enzyme and substrate,
given that protein expression levels in AI medium may vary. To this
end, we plotted the deacetylase activity of SIRT6 and SIRT7 as a function
of the ratio between the deacetylases and coexpressed RelA AcK310
variants (B).
No apparent correlation between enzyme-to-substrate ratio (-axis) and deacetylase activity (-axis)
was observed, demonstrating that measured deacetylation activities
are reproducible despite natural variabilities in protein expression
levels. It was previously demonstrated
that SIRT7 does not exhibit deacetylation
activity toward RelA AcK310, a finding corroborated using our assay
in live bacteria (A). Additionally, SIRT1 and SIRT2,
as well as HDAC6, are known to deacetylate RelA Lys310 , with previous studies having suggested this protein
to be a general substrate for class I HDACs. That said, we could demonstrate that RelA AcK310 can also be deacetylated
by SIRT3, SIRT5, SIRT6, and HDAC8. Our data clearly show that SIRT5
has the ability to recognize and directly deacetylate both the RelA
AcK310-derived peptide and folded domain, in . It is of note that a recent study in mammalian cell culture
found that Lys310 acetylation is positively correlated with SIRT5
expression . That
said, the results described here are to be expected, considering the
differences between the native cellular environment and that within
the bacterial cell. Much as an  assay, our
deacetylation assay conducted in bacteria shows that a given KDAC
is  of deacetylating a substrate. Whether
this reaction indeed occurs in the native mammalian cell depends on
numerous factors that either directly or indirectly associate with
one another, or could be greatly affected by protein concentrations,
subcellular compartmentalization, PTMs and other regulatory processes.
It is therefore important to compare results of studies performed  or in bacteria to those obtained in studies performed
in mammalian cells. To conclude, we have presented a novel system
for monitoring the
catalytic activity of mammalian KDACs with respect to native substrates
in live bacteria, using genetic code expansion technology. We report
the first examples of introduced SIRT6, SIRT7 and Zn-dependent
KDAC activity in bacteria, as well as mammalian enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis
of propionyl, butyryl and crotonyl groups in these cells. Furthermore,
we showed that relative to other KDACs, SIRT6 has lower deacetylase
activity toward all tested substrates. These results are in agreement
with previous studies describing the poor  deacetylase activity of SIRT6, and demonstrate that our method can
reveal differences in substrate recognition by various KDACs. Our methodology allows for the
monitoring of deacylation reactions under more biologically relevant
conditions, as compared to current peptide-based  methods, since a site-specifically acylated full-length substrate
is used. Also, lack of additional deacetylases in the bacterial cell
makes it an ideal “biological test tube”, given that
different KDACs (which are normally present in a mammalian cell) may
recognize and deacylate the same substrate, as demonstrated here.
Furthermore, our assay does not require any protein purification or
chemically modified peptides, is highly reproducible and allows simultaneous
examination of multiple KDACs by following a simple protocol. We have
also developed a modular acylated-peptide substrate that can be used
to mimic the use of synthetic peptides and which allows for comparison
with other experiments performed . Devising strategies to express and characterize the ten remaining
KDACs not studied in this work (, using truncated
KDACS or upon coexpression with regulatory proteins) will significantly
expand the scope of our assay. Moreover, with the increasing numbers
of newly evolved aaRS-tRNA pairs, as
reflected here using ncAAs –, this
strategy need not be limited to studying KDACs and deacylations, and
can be further expanded to investigate additional important PTMs (, phosphorylation or methylation). We believe that the
assay described here can yield more biologically relevant results
than existing  methods, when defining KDAC-substrate
recognition. When used in parallel with existing  methods, our assay can provide additional data, leading to more
biologically accurate insight that could otherwise be overlooked. Catalytic activity of mammalian KDACs expressed in . The indicated KDACs were coexpressed with
