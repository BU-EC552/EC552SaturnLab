Transcription factors
are master regulators of cellular fate and
function that orchestrate a coordinated response to a variety physiological
stimuli. Exogenous modulation of transcription factor activity therefore
holds much therapeutic potential, and is a critical tool for deciphering
complex cellular networks. The absolute requirement of assembly for
function means that protein–protein interaction (PPI) inhibition
is the optimal strategy for intervention, but transcription factors
are considered to be one of the most chemically intractable targets
in drug discovery. More generally, the
challenge of identifying PPI inhibitors means that the majority of
tools employed for studying these complexes are nucleic acid-based
(, siRNA, or CRISPR) and function to eliminate
the targeted protein from the cell. Despite their widespread use,
these methods have several drawbacks for studying PPIs; removal of
a protein from a system eliminates all of its known and unknown interactions
and functions. Thus, an observed phenotype may not necessarily be
attributed to a given PPI. In cases where validated PPI inhibitors
are available, the need for chemical synthesis and intracellular delivery
of such compounds places limitations on their adaptation and use.
We sought an alternative approach by introducing the components necessary
to synthesize a PPI inhibitor onto the genome of a human cell line.
Under this scenario, the intracellular production of a non-native
molecule is selectively induced by one or more disease specific signals  expression of the machinery needed for its production.
This approach would have the advantage that it eliminates the need
for chemical synthesis and intracellular delivery of the therapeutic
agent. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, we turned
to our recently reported cyclic peptide inhibitor of hypoxia inducible
factor 1 (HIF-1) heterodimerization. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor that drives the cellular
response to hypoxia, by altering the transcription
of over 300 genes, enabling cell survival
and growth in a low oxygen microenvironment. HIF-1 is composed of
an oxygen-regulated α-subunit (HIF-1α) and a constitutively
expressed β-subunit (HIF-1β). HIF-1α is marked for
degradation by prolyl hydroxylases that use oxygen as a substrate. Reduced oxygen levels lead to the stabilization and nuclear translocation
of HIF-1α, where it binds HIF-1β to form the active HIF-1
transcription factor. HIF-1α mounts an immediate response to
reductions of intracellular oxygen, while
two closely related isoforms, HIF-2α (also known as EPAS1) and
HIF-3α, are thought to regulate the response to prolonged hypoxia. The intricate interplay between HIF-α isoforms
in cancer is complex and yet to be fully deciphered, but the role
of HIF-1 activity in angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis is
well established. Tumours grow rapidly, outstripping
the capacity of the local vasculature, which results in a hypoxic
microenvironment; HIF-1α is overexpressed in many cancers, and oncogene activation and loss of tumor suppressor
function is shown to be associated with HIF-1. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf We recently reported an inhibitor of the HIF-1α/HIF-1β
PPI; this molecule (-CLLFVY, named P1) was identified from a genetically encoded library
of 3.2 million cyclic hexapeptides generated using split-intein circular
ligation of peptides and proteins (SICLOPPS). P1 selectively binds to the PASB domain of HIF-1α with a  of 124 nM, disrupts the HIF-1α/HIF-1β
PPI  and in cells, and inhibits HIF-1 signaling
in hypoxic cells. P1 is isoform-specific
and does not bind to, or affect the function of the closely related
HIF-2 isoform  or in cells. SICLOPPS generates cyclic peptides  PCC6803 ()
DnaE split inteins; the SICLOPPS protein
is composed of rearranged N-terminal and C-terminal split inteins
flanking a peptide extein sequence in the form of I-extein-I. The N- and C-terminal split inteins combine to form an active
intein that splices to cyclize the extein (). By altering the sequence of the SICLOPPS extein at the
DNA level, a variety of cyclic peptides and proteins, including randomized
cyclic peptide libraries, may be produced by this approach. Given our goal of incorporating the machinery
required for the
generation of a molecular PPI modulator into cells, and the significance
of HIF-1 in tumor survival and growth, we set out probe the possibility
of engineering the conditional production of P1 ( the corresponding SICLOPPS inteins) onto the chromosome of human
HEK-293 cells, and to assess the effect of genetically encoded P1
on HIF-1-mediated hypoxia response in these cells. Expression
and Processing of SICLOPPS Constructs in HEK-293
Cells http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf We began by constructing a cell line capable of conditional
P1 production and assessing the ability of the SICLOPPS construct
to correctly function in human cells. To achieve inducible expression
of the SICLOPPS construct encoding our HIF-1 inhibitor, we used a
cassette containing a CMV promoter, followed by two copies of the
tetracycline operator (tetO), enabling regulation of transcription
with doxycycline (dox), followed by the gene for SICLOPPS (A). Engineered  DnaE () inteins that
splice significantly faster than the  inteins
typically used in SICLOPPS were utilized for the production
of P1, with CLLFVY as the extein to be cyclized. We used flippase-flippase
recognition target (Flp-FRT) recombination to stably integrate this cassette onto the chromosome of human HEK-293
cells (T-REx-293) to give T-REx-P1 cells. We first sought to demonstrate
the production of functional P1 from the chromosome of human cells.
Intein production was probed by immunoblotting with an antibody against
the chitin-binding domain (CBD) present on the C-terminus of the N-terminal
intein; we only observed the CBD band in the integrated cells, and
only when cultured with dox (). The change in transcription of the chromosomal SICLOPPS construct
in response to dox was quantified by RT-qPCR as ∼37-fold in
both normoxia and hypoxia (B), which was also reflected at the protein level (C). A time course
measuring intein protein production over 24 h in hypoxic cells illustrated
the steady buildup of SICLOPPS inteins (D). The splicing efficiency of the SICLOPPS
protein encoding P1 was measured by immunoblot analysis for the CBD.
We only observed a single band at ∼18 kDa corresponding to
the spliced N-intein, suggesting full splicing of the SICLOPPS protein
(). We next sought to directly
detect the presence of P1 in T-REx-P1 cells. A synthetic sample of
P1 was prepared as a standard, and a peak with identical retention
time as this sample was observed in the lysate of T-REx-P1 cells treated
with dox (E).
Mass spectrometric analysis of this fraction from the cell lysate
revealed peaks corresponding to the mass of P1 (F) and the same as observed for the synthetic
standard (). This data demonstrates
that the  SICLOPPS inteins incorporated into the
chromosome of human HEK-293 cells are selectively produced in the
presence of dox, splicing post translation to give detectable levels
of P1 in the engineered human cell line. Production of a functional
cyclic peptide HIF-1 inhibitor from
the chromosome of human HEK-293 cells. (A) The chromosomally integrated
cassette enables the conditional expression of the SICLOPPS gene,
which encodes the  inteins with CLLFVY as the

the engineered cell line in hands and having demonstrated the conditional
production of P1, the functionality of the genetically encoded cyclic
peptide HIF-1 inhibitor was next probed. T-REx-P1 cells were transfected
with a HIF-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid, where activation
of HIF results in increased luciferase expression. As expected, there was no change in the luciferase signal
with dox in normoxia, while an ∼8-fold increase in luciferase
activity was observed in hypoxic T-REx-P1 cells without dox (G). Induction of
P1 production with dox in these cells resulted in a 50% decrease in
luciferase activity (G), suggesting that chromosomally encoded P1 inhibits HIF-1
function. To demonstrate that our observations are due to P1 and not
the SICLOPPS inteins, we generated a negative control cell line (T-REx-Scramble)
that chromosomally encoded CFVLYL (a scrambled
variant of P1) as the extein of  SICLOPPS inteins.
Splicing and conditional production of this scrambled peptide was
demonstrated by immunoblotting (). The above luciferase assay was repeated in this cell line, and
a ∼7-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed upon
induction of hypoxia without dox. There was, however, no change in
luciferase activity when these cells were incubated with dox in hypoxia
(G), indicating
that the scrambled peptide, or the SICLOPPS inteins do not affect
HIF-1 dimerization. To validate that the effect from P1 was on HIF-1
rather than on luciferase, we used a control SV40-luciferase plasmid,
and did not see any significant change in luciferase signal upon induction
of P1 in T-REx-P1 cells with dox (). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf The effect of chromosomally produced P1 on HIF-1 activity
was further assessed  its target genes vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX).
Chromosomally produced P1 reduced VEGF transcription by ∼30%
() and CAIX transcription by
∼45% (), with no effect
of the scrambled peptide observed on either gene (). Together, the above data demonstrates that chromosomally
encoded P1 is functional, and able to inhibit HIF-1 signaling in hypoxia
as expected from our previous studies with the synthetic, tat-tagged
variant of the compound. Engineering Physiological Control of Peptide
Expression http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf We next sought to engineer an additional layer
of control into the
above system by limiting the dox-dependent production of P1 to hypoxic
cells. The motivation for constructing this dual-control system was
our long-term goal of generating an  model
that contains such a circuit on its chromosome. Such a system would
not only allow expression of the HIF-1 inhibitors in hypoxic tissues
(as an HRE-only promoter would), but also allow temporal control over
initiation of P1 production  addition of dox.
Thus, the effect of HIF-1 inhibition at various stages of the tumor
development may be assessed. A hybrid promoter was designed and constructed;
three copies of the HRE from the inducible nitric synthase promoter were placed upstream of two copies of TetO,
resulting in a dual physiological and chemically controlled conditional
promoter that would only function in hypoxia and with dox (A). This cassette
was incorporated onto the chromosome of HEK-293 cells by Flp-FRT recombination
(as above) to give T-REx-HRE cells. Analysis of SICLOPPS cassette
transcription by RT-qPCR showed ∼9-fold upregulated transcription
in hypoxic cells that were incubated with dox (B). Immunoblot analysis showed the presence
of SICLOPPS protein only in cells cultured in hypoxia and with dox
(C), further
illustrating that the dual conditional promoter was functioning as
designed. The quantity of SICLOPPS protein was next compared with
T-REx-P1 cells. Interestingly, we observed higher levels of inteins
in the CMV-promoted cell line than the HRE-promoted cells incubated
in hypoxia and with dox (). Analysis
of these bands by densitometry indicated that there was ∼7-fold
more SICLOPPS intein in T-REx-P1 cells than in T-REx-HRE cells after
24 h. There are two reasons for this difference; first, the transgene
expression rate from the HRE promoter is known to be lower than that
from a CMV promoter, and second, the spliced product
of the promoted protein (P1) is an inhibitor of HIF-1 dimerization.
Therefore, as P1 builds up, it will also inhibit the transcription
factor promoting its own production. To further assess the effect
of this feedback loop on P1 production, a time course analysis of
intein production was conducted. We observed the steady buildup of
SICLOPPS mRNA (D) and protein (E) in hypoxic T-REx-HRE cells over 24 h, with a noticeable increase
in both after 8 h in hypoxia. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf The effect of P1 on the interaction of HIF-1α and HIF-1β
in hypoxic T-REx-HRE cells was next directly probed using an  proximity ligation assay (PLA). A
PLA signal was observed in hypoxic T-REx-HRE cells incubated without
dox (F, left-hand
panel), corresponding to the hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF-1α
and subsequent dimerization of HIF-1α and HIF-1β. The
PLA signal was not observed in these cells when incubated with dox
(F, right-hand
panel), nor in normoxic cells with or without dox (). This data demonstrates the disruption of HIF-1
dimerization by genetically encoded P1 in cells. The downstream
effect of disrupting HIF-1 dimerization with chromosomally
encoded P1 was elucidated  analysis of the transcription
of HIF-1 target genes VEGF and CAIX. The expression of both genes
was measured by RT-qPCR in cells incubated in hypoxia for 24 h with
or without dox. Induction of P1 with dox resulted in a ∼40%
reduction in VEGF mRNA (G) and a ∼50% reduction in CAIX mRNA in hypoxic T-REx-HRE
cells (H).
It should be noted that although lower amounts of the SICLOPPS protein
are produced in the T-REx-HRE cells than in T-REx-P1 cells, the extent
of the effect of P1 on these HIF-1 reporter genes was similar in both
cell lines, indicating that P1 concentration is not a limiting factor
in the observed inhibition of HIF-1 signaling. Conditional production of P1 in human cells.

HIF-1 signaling by using a focused microarray assessing expression
of 43 hypoxia-associated genes () in T-REx-HRE cells cultured in normoxia, hypoxia, and hypoxia with
dox. The data showed altered expression of these genes in T-REx-HRE
cells that were incubated in hypoxia with dox (A), illustrating the reprogramming of hypoxia
response by P1 in these cells. We have previously demonstrated ( and in cells) that CLLFVY
is a specific inhibitor of HIF-1 dimerization that does not affect
the interaction of HIF-2α and HIF-1β. We therefore aimed to illustrate the potential of using
genetically encoded P1 to separate the effect of HIF-1 inhibition
on hypoxia signaling from that of the closely related transcription
factor HIF-2. Our control experiments showed that treatment of T-REx-HRE
cells with dox had no effect on HIF-2α mRNA levels (), and that siRNA knockdown of HIF-2α
did not significantly affect the expression of HIF-1α mRNA or
protein () or SICLOPPS
protein (). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf The isoform-specificity of a number of HIF-target genes was
next
assessed using the above approach. While there was no effect on HIF-1α
mRNA from either HIF-1 or HIF-2 (B), HIF-3α expression seemed to be
primarily under the control of HIF-2 (C). We next assessed the role of HIF isoforms
on genes involved in angiogenesis (ANGPLT4 and VEGF) and erythropoiesis
(EPO). Following dox treatment, expression of EPO was decreased to
normoxic levels, whereas HIF-2α siRNA treatment caused no significant
change, indicating EPO is a HIF-1 specific target (D). In contrast, although inhibition
of HIF-1 significantly reduced the expression of ANGPLT4 (E) and VEGF (), a combination of both dox and HIF-2α
siRNA treatments was required to reduce gene expression to normoxic
levels. This data suggests that expression of ANGPLT4 and VEGF is
transactivated by both HIF-1 and HIF-2. Together, the inhibitory effect
of P1 expression on genes involved in the promotion of angiogenesis
and erythropoiesis supports previous assertions for the potential
of targeting HIF-1 dimerization as a therapeutic strategy to prevent
tumor vascularisation. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf Inhibition of HIF-1
dimerization and HIF-2α siRNA treatment
also differentially impacted upstream effectors of oxygen-dependent
regulation of HIF-1. Induction of P1 expression resulted in a decrease
in PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA whereas HIF-2α siRNA had no significant
effect (F and G). These observations are in line with the theory
that HIF-1 mediates the acute response to hypoxia whereas HIF-2 is
the prominent driver of adaptation to prolonged periods of hypoxic
conditions. Another gene primarily controlled
by HIF-1 was CAIX, with no significant effect from HIF-2α siRNA
alone (). This data was in agreement
with reports of CAIX as a HIF-1 specific target. Interestingly, although the stress response gene DDIT4
was upregulated in hypoxia, and inhibition of HIF-1 and HIF-2 significantly
reduced this induction, neither treatment was sufficient to reduce
DDIT4 expression to normoxic levels (H). DDIT4 is also induced in response to
endoplasmic reticulum stress and DNA damage related to the regulation
of reactive oxygen species, which may be a result
of hypoxic exposure, particularly when HIF response pathways are disrupted. Another gene of note was NOTCH-1, whose expression
was halved in hypoxic cells treated with dox, but doubled in hypoxic
cells treated with HIF-2α siRNA (I), illustrating the opposing regulatory
roles of HIF-1 and HIF-2 on this gene. The above data not only demonstrates
reprogramming of hypoxia response in our engineered human cell line,
but also illustrates the potential utility of using genetically encoded
P1, a HIF-1 specific inhibitor, to decipher the role of HIF isoforms
in hypoxia signaling in a variety of cell lines. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf Expression of genetically

of HIF-1 Dimerization Confers Synthetic Lethality
to Glycolysis Inhibitor http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00219/suppl_file/sb6b00219_si_001.pdf The effect on cell viability from
the disruption of hypoxia-response signaling  inhibition
of the HIF-1α/HIF-1β PPI by P1 was next probed. The viability
of T-REx-HRE cells cultured in normoxia or hypoxia, with or without
dox was assessed over 72 h using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT). No difference was observed in the viability of cells
cultured with dox  those that were not (A and ), indicating that inhibition of the
HIF-1α/HIF-1β PPI in hypoxic HEK-293 cells does not affect
viability. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that knockdown
of HIF-1α by siRNA sensitizes cells to the glycolysis inhibitor
2-deoxyglucose (2DG), leading to cytotoxicity. We questioned whether inhibition of HIF-1α/HIF-1β
PPI with P1 would render HEK-293 cells susceptible to 2DG. This was
initially assessed using MTT assays as above. We observed a 37% reduction
in viability after 72 h in hypoxic T-REx-HRE cells incubated with
dox (B). This
observation was further probed with a triplex assay that uses protease
biomarkers to assess viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis. We observed a 45% decrease in the ratio of viable
to cytotoxic T-REx-HRE cells after 72 h (C), in line with our observations from the
MTT assay. Interestingly, no significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity
was observed in these cells (D), suggesting that the observed synthetic lethality
of 2DG combined with P1 is not driven by apoptosis. Assessing the effect of HIF-1 inhibition on T-REx-HRE cell viability.
(A) Cells were incubated in hypoxia for up to 72 h with or without
1 μg/mL dox. Cell viability was assessed with an MTT assay.
(B) Cells were treated as in panel A with or without the addition
of 3 mg/mL 2DG to the culture media. (C) Cells were treated as in
panel B and incubated in hypoxia for 72 h. The ratio of cell viability
to cytotoxicity was determined using a triplex reporter assay. (D)
Cells were treated as in panel C and apoptotic cell death was assessed  a caspase 3/7 activity assay. Data are means ( = 3) ± SEM, * < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001, **** < 0.0001. The conditional production of P1, an inhibitor
of the HIF-1α/HIF-1β
PPI, has been encoded onto the chromosome of a human cell line, and
demonstrated to be a viable approach for the inhibition of HIF-1 signaling.
Two versions of this sentinel circuit are reported, one that initiates
P1 production in response to a chemical trigger (doxycycline), and
a second that requires an environmental signal (hypoxia) in addition
to doxycycline. In addition, the synthetic lethality of HIF-1 dimerization
inhibition (by P1) and inhibition of glycolysis (with 2DG) is demonstrated.
There is a growing body of evidence that inhibition of HIF-1, or redirection
of cellular pathways away from HIF-1 controlled mechanisms, may improve
the anticancer effects of current chemotherapeutic agents. Using the T-REx-HRE cell line reported here, a variety of chemotherapeutic
agents may be screened for synthetic lethality, or increased potency
when combined with HIF-1 inhibition. This
system has the potential to address several key questions
about HIF-1 and its necessity for the survival and growth of tumors.
Since its discovery, a large body of evidence has suggested that the
HIF-1 transcription factor plays a significant and critical role in
cancers, enabling survival and adaptation in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.
However, recent studies have indicated that HIF-1α also functions
in the cell as a monomer. Approaches that enable disruption
of the HIF-1 transcription factor, without reducing the cellular level
of HIF-1α have the potential to help decipher the role of HIF-1
in cancer. The sentinel circuit reported above may, for example, be
incorporated onto the genome of a variety of cancer cell lines that
are used in xenograft models. P1 production may be initiated at various
points during the tumor lifecycle, either globally or only within
the hypoxic regions of the tumor, illustrating the significance (or
not) of HIF-1 as a target for cancer therapy. Another possibility
is the generation of  models that contain
the sentinel P1-encoding circuit on their chromosome, enabling the
effect of long-term HIF-1 inhibition on tumor formation and maintenance
to be studied; the dual control promoter limits P1 production to hypoxic
cells and allows temporal control over P1 production, enabling the
study of HIF-1 inhibition at various stages of the tumor lifecycle. The concept of encoding the conditional production of a non-native
small molecule from the genome of engineered human cells has applications
beyond the HIF-1α/HIF-1β inhibitor described here. There
are a multitude of natural products used as therapeutics that may
be hard-coded onto cells  their biosynthetic machinery,
and produced as required. The use of sentinel circuits to induce apoptosis
in cells in response to specific DNA sequences, or encoding an environment-coupled kill-switch in bacteria attests to the possibilities. Other recent examples
include the introduction of new biological components into cells for
therapeutic purposes. As the field of synthetic biology advances, such examples will grow
in number and complexity. All

were transfected, at a ratio of 9:1, into T-REx-293 cells with Fugene
HD for the generation of stable cell lines. Polycolonal selection
was carried out with 200 μg/mL hygromycin in high dilution culture.
Integration was confirmed by western immunoblotting. Total RNA was extracted from cells

to expression of 18S and β-Actin and normoxic gene expression.
Hypoxia focused microarray was conducted using TaqMan Array Human
Hypoxia plates (Applied Biosystems). Expression values were expressed
as ΔΔC normalized to expression of 18S and
normoxic gene expression. For visualization
of expression
of CBD tagged inteins, cells were lysed in intein extraction buffer
(20 mM Tris.HCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.5 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) on ice for 15 min.
For visualization of HIF-1α protein, cells were lysed by incubation
on ice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris (pH
7.4), 150 μM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% v/v Triton X-100), and 1×
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) for 20 min. Cell lysates
were sonicated in an ice water bath then centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration in the
supernatant quantified by Bradford assay. Proteins were separated
on an SDS-PAGE gels (15% for CBD, 10% for HIF-1α), transferred
to PVDF membranes (Invitrogen) and subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Mouse monoclonal anti-CBD (E8034S, 1:250, New England Biolabs) anti-HIF-1α
(610958, 1:250 BD Biosciences) were diluted in PBS containing 5% nonfat
powdered milk and 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with the membrane overnight
at 4 °C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated antimouse
antibody was used as the secondary antibody, and monoclonal anti-βactin-peroxidase
antibody (A3854, 1:100 000, Sigma) served as a loading control.
Bound immunocomplexes were detected using ECL prime Western blot detection
reagent (RON2232, GE Healthcare) and analyzed using a ChemiDoc Imaging
System (Bio-Rad) and Image Lab 4.0 software (Bio-Rad). Detection of
Peptide in Cell Lysates by HPLC and MS T-REx-P1 cells were
scraped in ice cold PBS and the cell pellet froze
in N (l). The pellet was thawed and lysed in PMSF lysis
buffer (5 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.4 mM PMSF in PBS) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) by three freeze thaw cycles. TFA (10 μL)
was added to precipitate proteins and the lysate centrifuged (8000
rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was passed through a 10 kDa
cut off filter and the flow through collected and analyzed by reverse
phase HPLC on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters Atlantis
T3, Amide capped C18 5 μm, 6 × 100 mm column. Samples were
manually injected into a Waters flex inject system into the HPLC system
containing a Waters 1525 binary pump. One-minute fractions were collected
in the 5 min window around the elution time of the synthetic peptide
and analyzed by LC–MS. T-REx-P1, T-REx-Scramble,
or T-REx-HRE cells were transiently transfected with a HIF dependent
firefly luciferase reporter construct (pGL2-TK-HRE) or a HIF independent
firefly luciferase reporter construct (pGL3-SV40) as a control. Transfected
cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μg/mL dox.
After 24 h, cells were recovered and plated at 25 000 cells/well
in 96 well plates and incubated for 5 h before either hypoxic or aerobic
incubation for 16 h. Firefly luciferase activity was determined using
Bright-Glo Reagent (Promega) according to the manufacture’s
instructions. Luciferase signal was normalized using the corresponding
no-transfection controls for each plate. Duolink Proximity Ligation
Assay Duolink proximity
ligation assay (PLA) was conducted using the  PLA Kit (O-Link Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The antibodies used were rabbit monoclonal anti-HIF-1α
(NB100–449, Novus Biologicals) and mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1β
(H00000405- B01P, Abnova). Cells were treated with 1 μg/mL dox
in normoxia or hypoxia for 24 after which they were fixed with 2%
formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
(diluted in PBS) for 10 min. After preincubation with the Duolink
Blocking Reagent for 1 h, samples were incubated overnight with the
primary antibodies to HIF-1α (1:500) and HIF-1β (1:500).
Duolink PLA probes and reagents were added as recommended by the manufacture’s
instructions. Cells were imaged with a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss
Axio Vert.A1). T-REx-HRE
cells were seeded
at 20 000 cells/well on 6-well plates and incubated for 24
h such that cell density reached 50–70% confluence just prior
to transfection with siRNA. Cells were transfected with siRNA using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions for “forward transfection”.
Briefly, cell culture media was removed from cells and replaced with
serum-free OptiMEM cell culture medium (Life Technologies). siRNA
and Lipofectamine were separately, diluted in a volume of OptiMEM
equivalent to 10% of the final volume of cells, and incubated at RT
for 5 min. The diluted oligonucleotides and transfection reagent were
then combined, mixed gently, and incubated at RT for 10 min. The siRNA-Lipofectamine
complexes were added dropwise to cells which were then incubated at
37 °C for 24 h. The final concentration of siRNA was 5 nM and
the final amount of Lipofectamine was 0.2% v/v for all experiments.
Cells were either transfected with EPAS1 (HIF-2α) siRNA (Silencer
Select predesigned annealed human oligonucleotide duplex, s4700, Life
Technologies), scrambled siRNA (Silencer Select negative control number
2, Life Technologies) or vehicle alone. Following transfection, cells
were incubated in hypoxic or aerobic conditions for 24 h in the presence
or absence of 1 μg/mL for 24 h, then harvested for total RNA
extraction. T-REx-HRE
cells were seeded in
triplicate at 5000 cells per well on 96 well plates 24 h prior to
dosing with 1 μg/mL dox in 100 uL fresh DMEM, DMEM without glucose
or DMEM containing 3 mg/mL 2-deoxy-glucose. MTT-based cell proliferation
assays were performed on untreated cells on the day of treatment or
treated cells 24, 48, or 72 h after treatment, as follows: MTT (Sigma)
was prepared in sterile PBS added to cells at a final concentration
of 1 mM (10% v/v). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h
until intracellular punctate purple precipitated were clearly visible
under the microscope. 75 μL of the culture medium was the removed
from each well and 100 μL DMSO added. The cells were incubated
for 10 min in the dark, with agitation to dissolve the insoluble formazan
particles. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a microplate reader
(Tecan Infinite M200 Pro). ApoToxGlo assays (Promega) were performed
on cells 48 or 72 h after treatment with 1 μg/mL dox according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data analysis was performed with
Prism 6 (Graphpad Software). Statistical significance was evaluated
with an unpaired test for comparison between two
means and analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni method for multiple
comparisons. A value of  < 0.05 was considered
to denote statistical significance..
