Over the
past two decades, synthetic
biologists have sought to engineer microbes and their consortia to
execute ever more complex tasks. These range from the relatively straightforward
production of valuable chemicals to the
computation of complex logics that allow the microbes to make
sophisticated decisions to optimize such production or release therapeutics . There has been sustained interest
in both expanding the intrinsic size of these “circuits”
for implementation of even more ambitious functions and spreading
these circuits among different members of a population that distributes
the production load, allows reuse of components, or better utilizes space and growth. Certainly, in nature, microbial
populations and consortia spatially arrange themselves to form specialized
structures that have mechanical, developmental, and chemical advantages
over homogeneous distributions. Ideally, spatial patterning arises in a self-organized fashion
from control among individual cells, but shaping communities of cells
remains a challenge to engineer. In natural
systems, this organization often relies on highly specific communication
among cells and/or among highly spatially constrained signaling such
as cell contact-mediated mechanisms. In
bacteria, intercellular signaling systems like acyl homoserine lactones
(AHL) used in quorum-sensing (QS) tend to be fairly nonspecific and
long-range, while contact-mediated systems like Cdi-A/B are not easily programmable. However, it is possible to experimentally
explore the principles of spatial organization among microbial populations
by imposing external constraints on communication. Here, we
formulate a simple extensible modeling framework that
provides a systematic way to represent the dynamics of multistrain
communities, and design a compartmentalized culturing platform to
control the spatial arrangement of bacterial colonies harboring different
genetic circuits, where the communication between colonies is constrained
to specified channels on the device. We demonstrate the utility
of the approach by applying the framework to the canonical example
of lateral inhibition to predict the
emergence of stable contrasting patterns. Spatial
Distribution Introduces a New Control Knob to the Conventional
Gene Regulatory Network To explore the effects of spatial
configuration on a gene regulatory network, we propose a structured
bacterial communication device consisting of compartments and channels
(A). Bacterial
colonies harboring diffusible signal sensing/producing circuits grow
in segregated compartments, and channels establish specific cell–cell
communication between the connected colonies. In this section, we
develop a mathematical model of this system that permits analyzing
dynamic gene regulation distributed across colonies. A classical intracellular gene regulatory network
with two interacting
biochemical molecules  and  can
be modeled bywhere γ, γ are the linear
decay rates
of  and , and functions ,  characterize
inhibition or activation of a species’ production. Adapting
this equation to model intercellular communication between compartments
introduces spatially descriptive control parameters such as diffusivity,
channel length, and the configuration of compartments (“geometry”). Cells secrete diffusible molecules that are
transmitted along constrained paths to reach other cells, creating
biological reaction networks that span multiple cells. For this application,
we model colonies of cells whose physical locations are constrained
within compartments such that only signaling molecules diffuse through
the channels between the compartments. Each compartment is assumed
to consist of a single strain that produces only a single species
of diffusible molecule, either  or . While this work focuses on single-channel communication, the model
can also be extended to multichannel communication, where multiple
species of diffusible molecules are present. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf In a two-compartment
system, we describe the one-dimensional transit
of signaling molecules by introducing three new parameters: the channel
length  and the diffusivities ,  for molecules  and , respectively.
We approximate the full continuous-space diffusion model by a compartmental
model, with the concentration of biochemical species assumed to be
constant at all points within the same colony, and assume equal population
sizes and exponential growth rates for all colonies (). In doing so, we trade off
accuracy in spatial and temporal dynamics for a set of analytically
tractable equations that are reasonable when channels are narrow and
the volume of compartments and channels is negligible. Then the equations
for  and  produced in separate
compartments A and B, respectively, are given bywhere ,  and ,  designate the concentrations of  and  in compartments A and B. Increasing diffusivity
or decreasing channel length increases the practical strength and
rate of communication between neighboring compartments. Channeled
diffusion permits the design of arbitrary networks whose
dimensions increase with each added compartment by the number of biochemical
species present within that compartment. To model high-dimensional
networks, we use matrices to represent connections between compartments.
Given a system with  compartments producing  and  compartments producing , we define the vector  for the concentrations of  in compartments A,
and the vector  for the concentrations of  in compartments B. The vectors  and  are defined similarly
for molecule . We introduce the Laplacian matrix  to
represent connections between compartments (A). The entries of  arewhere  =  is the
length of the channel between compartments  and . The full biochemical dynamics are then described byFormulation of the  matrix
and the simulated gene expression behavior of an example network are
shown in A,B. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf A spatially distributed
gene regulatory network established by
intercellular communication between bacterial subpopulations separated
by compartments. (A) Example of the Laplacian matrix constructed from
an arbitrary network. Δ refers to the length
of the channels connecting adjacent compartments. (B) Simulated steady-state
pattern from the example network when cross-repressive interactions
are used between the two cell types. Color represents concentrations
of repressor in cell types A and B, normalized to the maximum concentration
across all colonies. The parameters are as given in  where corresponding biochemical parameter values
are equal between strains. (C) Examples of reducible spatial configurations.
Within each configuration, all channels are the same length and all
compartments of the same type are connected to the same number of
neighbors. Type A compartments have  neighbors of Type B, and Type B compartments have  neighbors of Type A. Triple dots indicate repetition
of the layout into infinity. Configurations such as these can be reduced
in dimension when solving for contrasting steady states. Dimensionality Reduction Enables Steady-State Analysis of Multicompartmental
Cross-Repressive Networks To apply our mathematical model
to a canonical example, we focus subsequent analyses on cross-repression
in multicompartmental networks. Lateral inhibition, or mutual inhibition
between adjacent units, is a common mechanism to generate contrasting
patterns. Here, ()
and () are Hill functions
describing repression of the production of the diffusible molecules
by the opponent molecules. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Supplementary Theory Section 3D Using dimensionality reduction, we
can identify the existence of stable contrasting steady-state patterns
in systems with a particular class of spatial configurations for which
all channels are the same length, all compartments of the same cell
type are connected to the same number of other compartments (“neighbors”),
and compartments with the same cell type have the same ratio of neighbors
belonging to one type  the other type. Arbitrarily
large multicompartmental systems with this structure can be reduced
in dimension to two-compartmental systems with multiplicative factor
adjustments to the diffusion (C, ). For the remainder of this paper we will consider the special
case where compartments of one cell type are connected only to compartments
of the other cell type. In particular, if each compartment of type
A has  neighbors and each compartment
of type B has  neighbors, then the concentrations
of repressors in each of the representative compartments ,  evolve as  with  replaced by  in  (for  and ) and by  in  (for  and ). These adjustments corroborate the intuition that a compartment
with more neighbors experiences higher diffusive in- and out-flux
of the signaling molecules. We use “diffusion-mediated lateral
inhibition” (DLI) to refer to multicompartmental cross-repressive
networks that satisfy the geometric constraint permitting reducibility.
The DLI system is analogous to contact-mediated lateral inhibition
mechanisms such as Notch-Delta, with the crucial distinction that
DLI acts through diffusion rather than direct contact. Contact-mediated
systems can be modeled by replacing the Laplacian matrix with an adjacency
matrix weighted by contact area as described
in . The DLI system can be experimentally implemented using two strains
of bacteria that communicate  orthogonal QS systems and internal inverters (repression circuits). One strain of bacteria
is seeded in each compartment with connected compartments alternating
between strain types. In this implementation,  is
the diffusible AHL produced by Strain A and  is
the orthogonal AHL produced by Strain B. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf To facilitate the choice
of genetic circuit components, we expand , ,  to model the dynamics of mRNA transcription/degradation,
protein translation/degradation, and AHL synthesis/degradation (). The equilibrium
solutions of the augmented model are equivalent to the equilibrium
solutions of the original model in  when  is given bywhere  is a
Hill function for repressor inhibiting the transcription of AHL synthase
and  is a Hill function for AHL activating
the transcription of the repressor in the other strain. The Hill coefficients,
dissociation constants (), and leakiness of  and  are set by the choice of QS and repressor molecules.
Independently, we can change the promoter copy numbers ,  as well as the translation
rates ϵ, ϵ and degradation rates γ, γ of AHL synthases and repressors. The composite
parameters α and α incorporate
the remaining parameters that we cannot easily vary, including maximal
transcription rates, mRNA decay rates, and the synthesis rates of
AHL by the synthases. The function  is
structured similarly except that the order of  and  is reversed (). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Patterning mechanism

the shape of the bistable region remains the same (relative to log-scale
axes) but shifts relative to the exact biochemical parameter values
(insets show the full shape of the bistable region). × indicates
an arbitrary set of fixed biochemical parameters that is bistable

the biochemical parameters indicated by × in (C), a graphical
test reveals that contrast may arise from a bistable system (1:1 and

input/output characteristics of strains in the reduced systems. Steady
states are indicated by ▲ (high expression) and ▼ (low

solid medium (yellow) into compartments and channels. Contrasting
patterns emerge when two strains have different sfGFP-tagged TetR
levels in steady state, either high (represented by colored colonies)
or low (represented by gray colonies). Graphical Analysis of a DLI Circuit Predicts Two Mechanisms
of Contrasting Pattern Formation http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Steady states for the two-compartment
diffusion system in —and hence for the reduced system—can be found graphically
by plotting the steady-state output  (or ) for constant input  (or ) and locating intersections
with a line of slope one, since at steady state the output equals
the input for the closed-loop system. The graphical test also reveals
the stability of the equilibria: one intersection implies the system
is monostable while three intersections imply the system is bistable
with an unstable homogeneous equilibrium (see ). Contrasting patterns
result from disparity in the steady-state target gene expression between
cross-repressive strains in a DLI system. Using graphical analysis
to assess system equilibria, we construct two-dimensional bifurcation
diagrams to reveal two different mechanisms for contrasting pattern
generation (). One mechanism originates from bistability, in which the system
parameters allow two alternative stable states of  and  production based on initial conditions and
possible intrinsic or extrinsic noise/perturbations. The second mechanism
occurs in a monostable system when one strain always expresses higher
levels than the other. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Supplementary Theory Section 5B http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Ultrasensitivity (cooperativity) in  and  is necessary
for bistable contrast.
Proper kinetic rate matching ensures that ultrasensitivity is preserved
in the feedback loop (). In addition to ultrasensitivity, DLI systems
must have sufficiently similar inhibition strength between strains
to be bistable. When the system loses bistability due to unbalanced
inhibition strengths, monostable contrast emerges, with the extent
of the contrast depending on the degree of imbalance (). Changing spatial
configuration triggers a bifurcation by modifying the effective inhibition
strength between strains (). DLI Network Design and Implementation Require Diffusible Cross-Repression
and a Geometric Culturing Platform Two  strains, A and B, were constructed using a pair of orthogonal
QS systems and a highly cooperative repressor, () (A). In both strains,  is translationally fused to the green fluorescent protein reporter, , with LAA  degradation tag in
the C-terminus to allow dynamic tracking of the cell state. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf The length of the channel () between compartments determines the AHL concentration in the neighboring
compartments as well as the intercompartmental communication lag time
(B). A partial
differential equation (PDE) model of AHL production, degradation,
and diffusion is used to optimize  for sufficient
diffusion of AHL to the immediate neighbors while preventing communication
between nonadjacent compartments (, ). Since
AHLs can be stable with a half-life of 6 hour up to days, an efflux channel is added to each compartment
to match the dilution rate of AHL to the degradation rates of other
proteins in the DLI circuit (, ). We use polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) as the mold to shape solid medium into compartments and channels
in specific geometries (C, ). Bistable and
Contrasting Gene Expression Was Observed for DLI
Circuit in Liquid Coculture http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Before testing pattern formation
in compartmental structures, we verified the predicted bistability
of the constructed circuits in liquid coculture. Numerical parameters
required for the biochemical model  were determined by experimental measurements of individual
modules of AHL reception/activation, transcriptional repression, and
AHL synthesis and diffusion in the DLI circuit (). Single-cell reporter gene expression
was measured using flow cytometry. To examine the existence of two
stable steady states, the cocultures were biased with varying external
concentrations of 3OC6HSL or 3OC12HSL. While the external AHL inductions
in monocultures of Strains A (A diamonds and the solid line for the Hill equation
fit) and B (B diamonds and the solid line for the Hill equation fit) resulted
in gently sloped sigmoid responses, the coculture showed a sharp transition
in steady state at 10 nM 3OC6HSL ( squares), which is a characteristic for
a bistable feedback loop. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Another characteristic of bistable systems is hysteresis.
To investigate
whether our system can reach two heterogeneous steady states in the
same culture condition depending on initial conditions, we preconditioned
Strains A and B monocultures with the saturated concentration (1 μM)
of either 3OC6HSL or 3OC12HSL prior to mixing them into a coculture.
The cocultures maintained the distinct gene expression states determined
by preconditions over time, while the similarly preinduced monocultures
lost the preconditioned state and exhibited sigmoidal induction curves
when the cultures were transferred to the fresh media (). The appearance of both the
sharp transition and hysteresis confirms
that cross-repression between Strains A and B produces an effective
intercellular bistable switch. Steady states of the
cross-repressive circuit characterized using
flow cytometry measurements in liquid cultures. Strain B was identified
using constitutively expressed . Varying concentrations
of (A) 3OC6HSL or (B) 3OC12HSL were externally added to the liquid
medium (-axis) and the medians of GFP fluorescence
after 8 hour of growth were recorded (-axis). The
markers indicate medians of GFP expression in the corresponding cultures.
All of the multistrain cocultures, each represented by □, ○,
×, exhibited contrasting expression profiles between Strains
A and B. While the monocultures of Strains A and B showed gently sloped
responses to external AHL with Hill function fits of  ≃ 50 nM and  ≃ 20 nM (solid lines), the two-strain
coculture showed a switch-like response at threshold [3OC6HSL] = 10
nM. Bottom scatter plots show similarity in gene expression patterns
between Strain A-biased coculture (A/B 3OC6HSL = 10 μM) and
Strain A-preinduced coculture at 8 hour of growth after removing external
AHL (A*/B AHL = 0), and Strain B-biased coculture (A/B 3OC12HSL =
100 nM) and Strain B-preinduced coculture at 8 hour of growth after
removing external AHL (A/B* AHL = 0). Bifurcation Is Observed
for Cells Grown on the Geometric Culturing
Platform Theoretically, the DLI system with two compartments
with proper channel length should behave similarly to the liquid coculture.
To investigate bistability and hysteresis in the geometric platform,
we preconditioned Strains A and B with either 1 μM 3OC6HSL or
1 μM 3OC12HSL, then washed away the preconditioning media and
plated the strains on solid medium before observing their gene expression
over time using a plate fluorimeter. The two-compartment geometry
plated with complementary strains maintained the preconditioned states
over 12 hour whereas the single-strain systems on the same setup quickly
lost the preinduced gene expression (A). When 3OC6HSL-preinduced Strain A was
seeded adjacent to Strain B, Strain A showed high reporter expression
while Strain B showed basal expression comparable to the single-strain
control, and this difference persisted in time. Similarly, 3OC12HSL-preinduced
Strain B seeded adjacent to Strain A showed high reporter expression
in Strain B and low reporter expression in Strain A, indicating that
contrasting patterns depended on initial conditions. Next, we evaluated DLI systems
in star geometries (B,C). We experimentally observed
that the system that was bistable in the two-compartments geometry
became monostable as the number of outer compartments of Strain B
surrounding Strain A increased to four or more (B). The monostable contrasting pattern exhibited
high reporter fluorescence in the center Strain A regardless of the
initial cell states. Strain B, on the other hand, did not shift from
monostable to bistable in our experimentally tested geometries, but
rather remained bistable with enhanced difference in reporter expression
levels as the number of surrounding A increased. Although the experimental
setup cannot physically accommodate > 6 compartments, the mathematical
simulation suggests that further increasing the number of surrounding
compartments would shift the system from bistable to monostable contrast
with Strain B expressing high reporter (D). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Our results show that we can easily
control the geometry of the
DLI system to affect circuit behavior and trigger a bifurcation. Geometry
may also offset imbalance in biochemical parameters (such as differences
in  and  in , ) and improve the stability of bistable
steady states (C). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Contrasting pattern formation

has revealed that
an astonishing range of microbial biodiversity may exist in a single
ecosystem. While this paper focuses on
spatial interactions between two strains of bacteria with two signaling
molecules, the theory may be generalized to handle an arbitrary number
of diffusible molecules. A system with  diffusible
molecules produced among  total compartments/colonies
can be modeled with · equations,
and the number of equations becomes even more if nondiffusible species
internal to the compartments must be included in the model. Hence,
arbitrary compartmental systems are generally high in dimension and
difficult to analyze in full, although symmetries in spatial configuration—such
as the alternating-neighbor pattern—may enable mathematical
reductions to simplify the search for particular solutions. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Supplementary Theory Section 3D http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00377/suppl_file/sb8b00377_si_001.pdf Supplementary Theory Section 5B For the analyzed DLI system, we explored
the role of geometry in
determining steady-state behavior. Although we implemented our system
with multistrain bacterial colonies, our theory can be applied to
isogenic populations as well. Here, the units of interest are individual
cells rather than colonies and communication must be contact-mediated
since diffusion-based signaling would form self-loops. Dimensionality
reduction still applies when cells can be categorized into two separate
“classes” by virtue of spatial configuration. Replacing
the Laplacian matrix with the adjacency matrix () simulates cell-to-cell contact
rather than diffusion. The remainder of the analysis then proceeds
as before. Extensive and detailed research has been performed to accurately
model the developmental processes in metazoans, and a handful of recent studies have highlighted
that spatially relevant parameters such as the number of neighbors
or the contact area between them can influence patterning activity
even in genetically isogenic cell populations. Our work offers
a unified interpretation of these results with respect to the imbalance
in transfer functions between pairs of representative cells. With
sufficient imbalance (), the system becomes monostable, essentially guaranteeing
the fate of the involved cells, and in fact only spatial control knobs
can introduce monostable contrast in isogenic populations, since changes
to biochemical parameters affect all cells equally. Furthering our
understanding of microscale pattern formation would require experimental
implementation of controllable contact-based systems. In bacteria,
several contact-dependent inhibition systems have been discovered for which potential harnessing strategies have been discussed. Genetic circuit design and implementation
are hampered by context-dependent
gene expression. Spatial control has
advantages over biochemical parameter modification in that it can
linearly modulate the effective interaction strength (D)  the
number of connected channels, and the modulation is robust to intracellular
conditions. Furthermore, physical separation of the composite strains
reduces resource competition among different strains to stabilize the intercellular network. However, spatial
control is constrained by structural limitations, such as the maximum
number of compartments that fit on the mold or whether the desired
communication network can be physically laid out without channels
intersecting each other. Thus, synthetic biologists should exploit
both biochemical and spatial control knobs for precise design and
engineering of microbial consortia. Bacterial

at 488 nm and 530/28 nm filter was used for sfGFP and the green epi
illumination at 532 nm and 605/50 nm filters were used for mRFP1.
Camera exposure time of 100 ms was used for all images. Computational
