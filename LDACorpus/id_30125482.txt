Cellular signaling networks
are capable of highly sophisticated signal integration and processing,
elegantly controlling a wide variety of cellular processes with high
temporal and spatial control. This control is achieved using a number
of fundamental information processing steps, including the use of
enzyme-controlled reversible covalent modifications (phosporylation,
acetylation, ubiquitination .), the compartmentalization
of proteins in organelles, the recruitment of otherwise weakly associating
proteins on membrane surfaces or dedicated scaffold proteins, and
the use of protease-mediated activation of inactive preproteins or
zymogens. These signaling pathways need to operate simultaneously
within the crowded environment of a cell, requiring a delicate balance
between orthogonality and communication between different signal transduction
pathways. The inherent modularity of natural signaling networks enables
the application of synthetic biology strategies, both to rewire existing
signaling pathways and to recreate essential features of biological
signal processing using  biomolecular networks.
Thus far, most efforts in the latter area of bottom-up synthetic biology have focused on one specific type of signal transduction
(protease, phosphorylation or scaffolding), but the construction of
synthetic protein-based signaling networks that combine different
signaling strategies is mostly lacking. In this work we report
a generic strategy to integrate two important
signal transduction mechanisms, protease-mediated signaling and template-mediated
assembly of protein complex formation. The classic example of protease
signaling is the blood coagulation cascade, where sequential activation
of serine proteases (coagulation factors) is essential for hemostasis. Since this finding, the importance of protease-based signal transduction
has been established in numerous pathways including cell proliferation
(ADAM10 and γ-secretase), cell death
(caspases) and the immune response (cathepsins). Protease signaling often involves cascades
of sequential activation of pro-enzymes, which provides multiple levels
of control and an efficient mechanism of signal amplification. The
inherent modularity of protease-based signaling and the possibility
for signal amplification make protease activity an attractive tool
to control and construct protein-based signaling networks, both  and . For example, Lim
and co-workers developed a synthetic Notch receptor that upon antigen
binding to its artificial receptor domain gets cleaved, releasing
a non-native transcriptional activator domain that induces the expression
of a second chimeric antigen receptor. Huck and co-workers recently reported the  construction of a trypsine-based reaction network that showed oscillations
in enzyme activation by combining autoactivation of the protease trypsin
with delayed feedback. Modular protein switches based on autoinhibited proteases
have been engineered by Alexandrov and co-workers and used as biosensors
to detect protease activity, ligand binding and protein–protein
interactions. The recruitment of proteins
on scaffold proteins represents another
important mechanism for spatiotemporal control of signal transduction
cascades. Scaffold proteins are highly
flexible and modular platforms that enable the cell to perform a wide
variety of functions using a limited number of components. Well-known examples include Crk, a family of scaffold proteins involved in cellular transformation,
cytoskeletal changes and phagocytosis, and the Ste5- and KSR- scaffold
proteins involved in the MAPK pathway. Another major class
of natural scaffold proteins are the 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 proteins
exist as constitutive homo- or heterodimers based on 7 different isoforms
(β, ε, η, γ, ζ, σ, τ), with each monomer containing an amphipathic ligand-binding groove
that allows specific binding of target proteins that typically contain
a phosphorylated serine and threonine binding motif. 14-3-3 proteins
lack intrinsic enzymatic activity but exert their biological activity
by enhancing the interaction of two target proteins, by binding a
target protein to prevent its interactions with other biomolecules,
or shield its sequence-specific or structural features for example
to protect against degradation. Through these mechanisms
14-3-3 is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular
processes including signal transduction, metabolism, cytoskeletal
dynamics, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. An attractive
feature of 14-3-3-mediated scaffolding is that the interaction of
14-3-3 with certain target proteins can be reversibly induced by addition
of small molecules such as fusicoccin. This property has been used
to develop a chemically induced dimerization system based on the fusicoccin-promoted
interaction between the tobacco plant 14-3-3 protein (T14-3-3c) and
a C-terminal peptide from the H-ATPase PMA2 (CT52). More recently, we used this T14-3-3c-CT52 interaction
to dimerize two monomers of apoptosis-initiating caspase-9 that were
fused to CT52, and thereby activated caspase-9 in a fusicoccin-dependent
manner on a T14-3-3c scaffold. While endogenous 14-3-3-mediated signal transduction is intimately
connected with phosporylation-based signaling, we here introduce a
generic approach to control 14-3-3 activity by proteases. Protease-based
control of 14-3-3 activity is achieved by fusion of inhibitory ExoS
peptides  protease-cleavable flexible peptide
linkers. Three different architectures are explored to achieve optimal
control of 14-3-3 scaffolding activity using either one or two monovalent
ExoS peptides or a single bivalent ExoS peptide. The relative efficiency
of these architectures to block the 14-3-3 templating activity is
systematically studied using the previously reported fusicoccin-induced
dimerization and activation of caspase-9. The protease activatable
14-3-3 scaffolds are successfully applied to construct synthetic biomolecular
signaling networks, including a three-step (enzyme → scaffold
→ enzyme) synthetic signaling cascade and a self-activating
protease signaling network. Design of Protease-Activatable
14-3-3 Proteins In this
study we used the tobacco 14-3-3 homodimer (T14-3-3cΔC, from
here called T14-3-3) to assess various control strategies. This plant
14-3-3 protein is attractive for the bottom-up construction of orthogonal
signaling networks, because it is less likely to bind to endogeneous
14-3-3 target proteins in mammalian cells. Two tobacco 14-3-3 monomers were covalently connected using a flexible
(Gly-Gly-Ser)-linker to allow specific intramolecular
control of the scaffolding activity of a T14-3-3 dimer. 14-3-3 activity
was blocked by intramolecular binding of one or two inhibitory ExoS
peptides ().
The ExoS peptide originates from the C-terminal region of  toxin exoenzyme S (QGLLDALDLAS) and binds to 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-independent
manner. Three different designs for protease-activatable
T14-3-3 were explored. In the first design one ExoS peptide is fused
to the C-terminal T14-3-3 domain  a (Gly-Gly-Ser)-linker that contains a TEV protease cleavage site, blocking
a single T14-3-3 binding site (; dT1433-Exo). The second design is similar, but contains
a bivalent ExoS peptide that binds both T14-3-3 binding sites simultaneously
(; dT1433-BiExo).
The two ExoS sequences in the bivalent ExoS are linked by a (Gly)-linker, as this linker length was found to be sufficient
to cover the 30 Å distance between the two 14-3-3ζ binding
pockets for binding of a natural bivalent peptide derived from protein
kinase C-ε. In the third approach
two monovalent ExoS peptides are attached to the T14-3-3 dimer  (Gly-Gly-Ser)-linkers, one to the N-terminus
and the other to the C-terminus of the engineered T14-3-3 platform
(; Exo-dT1433-Exo).
The N-terminal linker contains a Factor Xa protease cleavage site,
and the C-terminal linker includes a TEV protease recognition site.
This construct thus requires cleavage by two proteases to become fully
liberated, which should allow dual input control of the T14-3-3 scaffold
protein. Engineered protease-activatable dT14-3-3 protein scaffolds. (A)

affinity of the interaction between 14-3-3 and the monovalent
and bivalent ExoS peptides is important for successful control of
14-3-3 scaffold activity. Fluorescence polarization titration experiments
were used to systematically investigate the binding of fluorescently
labeled monovalent and bivalent peptides containing either the wild-type
ExoS peptide or the L423A, L426A, L428A, and L423A/L426A mutants (). These mutations
were chosen because hydrophobic interactions of these leucines dominate
the interaction with the 14-3-3 binding site, and mutations of these
residues have been shown to reduce 14-3-3-binding mediated cellular
toxicity of the full exoenzyme S. Wild-type monovalent ExoS bound
to T14-3-3 with a  of 14.1 ± 0.9
μM, which is 10-fold weaker than the  of 1.14 ± 0.05 μM reported previously for binding
of wt ExoS to 14-3-3ζ. T14-3-3
binding was essentially abolished for all monovalent mutant peptides
except for the L423A mutant, which showed a ∼9-fold decrease
in affinity compared to the wild-type peptide ( = 127 ± 16 μM). Titration of T14-3-3 to bivalent
wt ExoS revealed a  of 45.5 ± 8.5
nM, which represents a 300-fold increase in affinity between mono-
and bivalent ExoS binding. A similar ∼100-fold affinity enhancement
has been observed for the 14-3-3ζ binding of two monovalent
phosphorylated peptides of protein kinase C-ε fused using the
same (Gly)-linker. The bivalent
L423A mutant ExoS peptide also showed enhanced binding compared to
monovalent L423A ExoS, although the increase in affinity was more
modest, showing a 20-fold lower  of
5.9 ± 0.9 μM. The bivalent stabilization can be quantitatively
understood using a thermodynamic model that describes the binding
of the bivalent peptide to T14-3-3 (), as a function of the monovalent binding affinity () and the effective concentration () for binding the second T14-3-3 binding site after
the first has been bound (). The
model yields an effective concentration of ∼1 mM and explains
how the enhancement in affinity for bivalent ligands depends on the
affinity of the monovalent peptide. Protease-Triggered Activation
of ExoS-Inhibited T14-3-3 Scaffolds The mono- and bivalent
ExoS and ExoS L423A peptides together provide
a set of inhibitors with affinities ranging between 45 nM to 127 μM,
allowing a systematic screening of the optimal affinity for protease-activatable
14-3-3 constructs. For all three designs shown in , protease-activatable T14-3-3
scaffold proteins with either wild-type peptide (Exo) or the L423A
mutant (Exo*) were made, yielding a total of 6 different constructs:
dT1433-Exo, dT1433-Exo*, dT1433-BiExo, dT1433-BiExo*, Exo-dT1433-Exo,
Exo*-dT1433-Exo*. The scaffold proteins were expressed in  BL21(DE3) and sequentially purified by Ni and Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography using their N-terminal
His-tag and C-terminal Strep-tag, respectively. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00217/suppl_file/sb8b00217_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00217/suppl_file/sb8b00217_si_001.pdf All proteins
were obtained in high purity and sufficient yield (≥1 mg/L)
for our studies (). Please note
that this yield could probably be further improved by a systematic
screening for optimal expression conditions (temperature, medium,
fermentation) and a more efficient purification procedure. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed that each of the scaffold proteins was efficiently
and specifically cleaved by its target protease into the expected
molecular fragments (B,C,D, ). To monitor 14-3-3 scaffold activity,
we employed the fusicoccin-stabilized
interaction between 14-3-3 and a caspase-9-CT52-fusion protein. Binding of this fusion protein on the 14-3-3
scaffold promotes caspase-9 (C9) dimerization, resulting in caspase-9
activation that can be monitored by cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate
(A). Because
CT52 has been shown to bind to the T14-3-3 dimer with a  of ∼1 nM in the presence of fusicoccin, this assay provides a rigorous test for the
ability of the ExoS peptide to block the 14-3-3 site. For each scaffold
protein, 14-3-3-templated caspase-9 activity was determined before
and after protease-cleavage and compared to a control in which the
same concentration of native T14-3-3 dimer was used (representing
100% activity) and a control in which no 14-3-3 was present (representing
0% activity). Scaffold proteins containing a single ExoS peptide
at the C-terminus
of the 14-3-3 dimer (dT1433-Exo and dT1433-Exo*) showed scaffold activities
of 40% and 50%, respectively (E). In both cases, 14-3-3 scaffold activity was almost
completely restored following protease-cleavage. As expected, more
efficient inhibition of 14-3-3 activity was observed for the variant
with wt ExoS. Although the affinity of the wild-type ExoS peptide
( = 14.1 ± 0.9 μM) is high
enough to ensure essentially complete intramolecular complex formation,
the scaffold activity is only partially inhibited because C9-CT52
strongly competes with this interaction in the presence of FC. The
bivalent ExoS peptides proved more effective in blocking the 14-3-3-templated
caspase-9 activation than the monovalent ExoS peptide, showing a residual
activity of ∼15% for the construct with wt ExoS peptides (dT1433-BiExo, F, left) and 30%
for the construct with the bivalent L423A mutant ExoS (F, right). Despite the strong
bivalent interaction between the 14-3-3 dimer and the bivalent ExoS
peptide, protease cleavage still resulted in efficient activation
of the 14-3-3 scaffold, yielding restored activity levels between
80 and 85% (F). The most effective control of T14-3-3 scaffolding activity
was
observed for the constructs having monomeric ExoS peptides fused to
each end of the 14-3-3 dimer. The construct with two wt ExoS peptides
(Exo-dT1433-Exo) showed complete inhibition of scaffold-activity,
while the scaffold protein with ExoS-L423A displayed ∼15% remaining
activity (G).
Despite this strong blockage, efficient restoration of scaffold activity
was observed in both cases upon treatment with both proteases leading
to 75 and 80% recovery, respectively. As a result, the Exo-dT1433-Exo
displayed the largest dynamic range of scaffold activation of all
six protease-activatable T14-3-3 scaffold variants. While both proteases
are required to achieve maximal activation, each of the proteases
by itself also induced partial restoration of scaffold activity. Digestion
of the proteins with Factor Xa protease resulted in scaffold activities
of ∼35% and ∼45% for the constructs containing wild-type
and mutant ExoS peptides (G), respectively, corresponding well to the data obtained
for dT1433-Exo and dT1433-Exo*. Remarkably, the TEV protease-cleaved
proteins displayed a significantly higher C9 activity than the Factor
Xa-digested proteins, with scaffold activity levels of ∼45%
and ∼70% for the resulting Exo-dT1433 and Exo*-dT1433. Possibly
the attachment of the linker connecting the ExoS peptide to the N-terminus
of the N-terminal T14-3-3 monomer, which is oriented away from the
T14-3-3 binding grooves, led to a lower effective concentration of
the peptide close to its binding pocket(s). This effect might have
been enhanced by the reversed orientation of the ExoS peptide in the
T14-3-3 binding groove compared to other target peptides, which substantially
increases the distance between the C-terminus of the ExoS peptide
and the N-terminus of the N-terminal T14-3-3 monomer (PDB: 2O02). Further, the presence of a His-tag and thrombin cleavage
site directly upstream of the N-terminal ExoS peptide may have reduced
its binding affinity. Protease-regulated dT14-3-3
scaffold activation. (A) Schematic
representation of dT14-3-3 scaffold activation. After cleavage of
the ExoS peptide by the protease (TEV and/or Xa), dT14-3-3 is mixed
with the fusion protein caspase-9-CT52 (C9-CT52) and small-molecule
fusicoccin (FC). Fusicoccin-induced binding of C9-CT52 to dT14-3-3
induces C9 dimerization and subsequent activation. (B–D) SDS-PAGE

in the absence of 14-3-3-scaffold protein. Substrate conversion rates
(a.u./min) were determined from the initial slopes of the fluorescence

next step we combined
the protease-controlled 14-3-3 platform with previously developed
molecular signaling modules to yield synthetic signaling cascades.
We previously reported a supramolecular system to control caspase-9
dimerization based on the cucurbit[8]uril (Q8) mediated dimerization
of FGG-modified proteins. In this system
addition of the macrocyclic host Q8 can be used to control the dimerizaton
of caspase-9 with an N-terminally fused FGG motif (FGG-C9) (). To allow coupling of this Q8-induced dimerization system
upstream of the protease-activable 14-3-3 scaffolds, we introduced
caspase-9 recognition sites in two protease-activatable 14-3-3 scaffold
proteins, dT1433-BiExo* (dT1433-LEHD-BiExo*, B) and Exo-dT1433-Exo (Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo, D). These scaffolds
were chosen as they were blocked with different stringency, while
the residual affinities of the ExoS and bivalent ExoS* peptides formed
upon protease-cleavage for 14-3-3 are similar. Since caspase-9 activitity
is used as an input, an alternative output platform to measure 14-3-3
scaffold activity was required. We therefore developed a new read-out
system for 14-3-3-templated protein dimerization based on complementation
of the NanoBiT split-luciferase system (, A). The large NanoBiT fragment (LgNB)
was fused to a CT52 peptide (LgNB-CT52), and the small NanoBiT fragment
was fused to CT32 (SmNB-CT32), an N-terminally truncated version of
CT52 which has similar FC-controllable T14-3-3 binding properties.
To ensure low background activity in the absence of a template, a
low affinity variant of small NanoBit was used ( = 190 μM). The split NanoLuc system provided a
very robust read-out of 14-3-3-templating activity, showing a ∼100-fold
increase in bioluminescence emission upon addition of T14-3-3 in the
presence of FC (). The higher
response observed for the split Nanoluc system compared to the C9-CT52
system can be attributed to the lower amount of complementation in
the absence of the 14-3-3 scaffold. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00217/suppl_file/sb8b00217_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00217/suppl_file/sb8b00217_si_001.pdf Having established orthogonal
input and output functions for the
14-3-3 scaffold, we assessed its performance in a three-step signaling
cascade whereby Q8-induced FGG-C9 activation leads to activation of
the dT14-3-3 scaffold, which subsequently allows scaffolding of both
LgNB-CT52 and SmNB-CT32, resulting in complementation and restoration
of NanoBiT luciferase activity (A). dT1433-LEHD-BiExo* and Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo
were incubated with FGG-C9 in the absence and presence of Q8 and samples
were taken at various time points for analysis by SDS-PAGE and bioluminescent
actvity assays. SDS-PAGE analysis showed almost complete removal of
the ExoS peptides for both scaffolds within 20 min in the presence
of Q8, while only ∼50% cleavage was observed after 2 h in the
absence of Q8. The corresponding activation of 14-3-3 templating activity
was monitored by measuring the bioluminescence intensity after addition
of LgNB-CT52, SmNB-CT32, FC and furimazine to each sample (). In the presence of Q8, a strong increase
in bioluminescence was observed within 10–20 min, which coincides
with the kinetics of protease-induced scaffold cleavage observed with
SDS-PAGE analysis. (B,C,D,E, ). In
the absence of Q8, self-complemented FGG-C9 also induced an increase
in bioluminescent emission, but this activation was much slower than
in the presence of Q8. The fully cleaved dT1433-LEHD-BiExo* and Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo
scaffolds showed a ∼6-fold and ∼80-fold increase of
the NanoBiT bioluminescence compared to the nonactivated scaffolds,
respectively (C,E). The higher level of activation for Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo
compared to that of dT1433-LEHD-BiExo* is consistent with the more
stringent inhibition of the undigested scaffold, which was also observed
for the C9-CT52 activation (F,G). To assess whether the different reactions
in the signaling cascade
are orthogonal we also monitored the increase of Q8-triggered 14-3-3-templated
NanoLuc complementation by incubation of all components in one pot.
Similar levels of luciferase activity enhancement were reached upon
addition of Q8, showing a ∼17- and ∼86-fold increase
in split-NanoBiT activation for the dT1433-LEHD-BiExo* and Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo
scaffold, respectively (F,G). While the reaction rates in the absence of Q8 were not
influenced, the Q8-induced cleavage appeared somewhat slower compared
to the separately incubated reactions. Nonetheless, these results
confirm that the reaction components are mutually compatible and operate
essentially orthogonal to each other. Synthetic signaling cascade based on caspase-9
activatable dT14-3-3.

containing an N-terminal FGG-motif (FGG-C9) can be activated by cucurbit[8]uril(Q8)-mediated
dimerization in a supramolecular fashion. The active caspase-9 cleaves
off the ExoS peptides from the Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold,
which induces NanoBiT luciferase complementation by allowing fusicoccin-enhanced
LgNB-CT52 and SmNB-CT32 binding. (B,D) SDS-PAGE gel analysis of the

incubated with 5 μM FGG-C9, and 10 μM Q8 at 37 °C.
At different time points these samples were diluted 5 times, and mixed
with 40 nM LgNB-CT52, 40 nM SmNB-CT32, 5 μM FC, 1 mg/mL BSA,
and 2000-fold diluted furimazine, in 20 mM NaHPO (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM TCEP. The fold change
in bioluminescence at 458 nm was determined from the bioluminescence
emission spectrum measured at each time point compared with the bioluminescent
emission spectra obtained for the scaffold that had not been incubated
with FGG-C9 and Q8. (F,G) Synthetic signaling cascade performed in
a one-pot assay. Fold change in bioluminescence emission at 458 nm

of 10 μM Q8, and further incubated with 40 nM LgNB-CT52, 40
nM SmNB-CT32, 5 μM FC, 1 mg/mL BSA, in 20 mM NaHPO (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM TCEP, at
37 °C. At different time points furimazine (final dilution 2000×)
was added. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00217/suppl_file/sb8b00217_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00217/suppl_file/sb8b00217_si_001.pdf An intruiging property of protease-based
signaling is the possibility for self-activation. Self-activation
is a powerful mechanism of positive feedback control that has been
reported for a variety of proteases including caspases, the retroviral proteases involved in HIV, and trypsinogen. The successful construction of
caspase-9 activated 14-3-3 scaffolds provides an attractive synthetic
platform to study self-activation of protease activity. By replacing
the Q8-activatable caspase-9 with the original caspase-9-CT52, a system
can be created in which C9-CT52 functions as both in- and output of
the protease-controlled 14-3-3 scaffold (). Self-activation was evaluated using the
Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold, as this scaffold showed the strongest
inhibition and therefore the highest fold increase in activation.
Self-activation of the scaffold was assessed over time by measuring
C9-CT52 activity using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-LEHD-AFC, in the
absence and presence of FC (). To investigate the influence of the C9-CT52 concentration
on the activation kinetics, experiments were done using 50, 100, or
200 nM C9-CT52 and 400 nM of Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold. As
a reference, the background activity of C9-CT52 alone was measured,
and the maximum activity that could be reached was measured by the
activation of C9-CT52 on the regular 14-3-3 scaffold in the presence
of FC. In the absence of FC, C9-CT52 activity on the caspase-9 activatable
scaffold was similar to the background activity observed in the absence
of any scaffold protein (B, ) over a period
of 23 h. In the presence of FC, the activity of C9-CT52 on the scaffold
slowly increased over time, reaching maximal activity after 6–7
h for the two highest concentrations of C9-CT52 (100, 200 nM), while
∼50% reactivation was obtained after 23 h when using 50 nM
C9-CT52. Importantly, self-activation of caspase-9 activity was not
observed when the Exo-dT1433-Exo scaffold was used, as this scaffold
cannot be cleaved by caspase-9. The slightly higher caspase-9 activity
that is observed in the presence of Exo-dT1433-Exo compared to the
background, can be attributed to competition between C9-CT52 and the
ExoS peptides for binding to the scaffold in the presence of FC. For
all samples a small decrease in C9-CT52 activity was observed after
23 h, which probably reflects a decrease in intrinsic enzyme stability.
The initial velocity of caspase-9 activation roughly correlates with
the concentration of C9-CT52, showing a 1.8-fold increase between
50 nM and 100 nM, and 3.7-fold increase between 50 nM and 200 nM,
respectively (B,C, ). The slow 14-3-3 activation
kinetics are probably due to a combination a high  and a low  of caspase
9 for the 14-3-3-scaffold proteins. These parameters are likely to
be similar to those for the Ac-LEDH-AFC peptide probe, for which a  of 600 μM and  of 0.2 s have been determined, which
corresponds to a / = 0.33 × 10 μM s or 1.2 μM h. As far as we
know, this system represents the first successful example of an  protease signaling network with positive feedback
loop. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00217/suppl_file/sb8b00217_si_001.pdf Self-activation assay using the Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold.
(A) Schematic representation of self-activation of the Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo
scaffold in the presence of C9-CT52 and FC. Background activation
leads to cleavage of the scaffold which induces dimerization and activation
of C9-CT52 on the scaffold, enhancing the cleavage of the scaffold,
resulting in higher C9-CT52 activation. (B) Activation (U mg) of C9-CT52 (200 nM) on the Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold (400
nM) probed by a fluorogenic substrate (Ac-LEHD-AFC) in the absence
(light gray) and presence of 10 μM FC (dark gray). Controls
are shown as well of the C9-CT52 activity on the Exo-dT1433-Exo scaffold
(400 nM) in the presence of 100 nM C9-CT52 and 10 μM FC (black)
and the background activity of solely C9-CT52 (100 nM, light blue).
Maximum activity that can be reached is obtained by measuring the
activation of C9-CT52 (100 nM) in the presence of the native dT14-3-3
scaffold (400 nM) and 10 μM FC (dark blue). Samples were incubated
at 18 °C in 20 mM NaHPO (pH 7.0), 150
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM TCEP. At each time point Ac-LEHD-AFC
was added to a final concentration of 200 μM. Error bars represent
SEM ( = 2). (C) Activation (U mg) of C9-CT52 on the Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold from the same
assay as in B and  (200 nM C9-CT52
black triangle, 100 nM C9-CT52 gray square, 50 nM C9-CT52 light gray
circle), error bars represent SEM ( = 2). In this work we introduced a generic and modular approach to enable
protease-based control over protein scaffolding, one of the key mechanisms
used in signal transduction in nature. Inspired by the mechanism used
in many natural zymogens, different protein architectures were explored
in which the 14-3-3 binding sites were intramolecularly blocked by
one or more ExoS peptides. The modularity of the system enabled easy
exchange of protease recognition sites and allowed systematic tuning
of the switching properties by tuning the affinity and interaction
of the ExoS peptide and 14-3-3. The ability to rationally modulate
the relative strength of the intramolecular blocking allows adjustment
of the platform depending on the strength of the downstream protein–protein
interaction; , in this work we used the strong
interaction between 14-3-3 and CT52 in the presence of fusicoccin,
which required strong intramolecular blocking of both 14-3-3 binding
sites using wt ExoS. However, when using 14-3-3 target proteins with
lower affinities (, phosphorylated peptides or
proteins), weaker intramolecular blocking architectures may be more
suitable. The protease-activatable 14-3-3 scaffold proteins
developed here
represent versatile molecular hubs to integrate protease- and scaffold-based
signal transduction in  protein-based molecular
logic networks. The modularity of the platform
provides ample opportunity to program various form of logic operations,
a first example of which was provided by Exo-dT14-3-3-Exo whose full
activation required the presence of two different proteases. Similarly,
OR gates could be obtained by incorporating multiple protease recognition
sites in a single linker, while more robust AND-gates could be created
by fusing two wild-type bivalent ExoS peptides to the T14-3-3 dimer.
Next to altering the protease-controlled 14-3-3 scaffold itself, the
scaffold could be combined with other protease-based synthetic signaling
networks, such as the protease-activatable switches developed by Stein
and Alexandrov, which could be introduced both
upstream or downstream of the protease-controlled 14-3-3 scaffold. The protease-activable 14-3-3 platform presented here therefore
provides an orthogonal and tractable molecular model system to understand
the molecular mechanism of scaffold activity regulation. Compared
to natural proteases, where self-activation typically results from
autocatalytic cleavage of a precursor pro-enzyme, our system provides
enhanced control of self-activation, both by adjusting the concentration
of the C9-CT52 and by regulating the concentration of the small-molecule
inducer fusicoccin. This approach could be easily extended to other
proteases that require dimerization for activation such as the HIV-1
protease and provide more insight into the critical
aspects of controlling protease-based signaling, imbalances of which
have been implicated in in several diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis,
neurological disorders and cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. The genetic encoding of protease-activatable
14-3-3 should also allow  applications, either
as part of synthetic, orthogonal signaling networks or by integration
with endogeneous protease-signaling networks involved in cell proliferation,
cell cycle control, apoptosis and the immune reponse. In addition,
protease-activatable 14-3-3 activity could be connected to some of
the protease-inducible or -inducing systems that have been engineered
in recent years, including split-caspases, split-TEVs, chimeric adapters that reroute tyrosine kinase signaling, membrane-bound receptors for monitoring of protein–protein
interactions (PPIs) or photoactivatable
proteases. Finally, the orthogonal control
over the activity of specific 14-3-3 homo- or heterodimers offered by protease-activatable 14-3-3 may provide
an attractive approach to further unravel the signaling roles of 14-3-3
proteins in living cells. Protease Cleavage and Caspase-9
Activation Optimal
cleavage conditions were determined by incubating Exo-dT1433-Exo protein
(2 μM in 80 μL) with 3 different concentrations of Factor
Xa protease (Novagen, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 μg) and TEV protease
(Promega, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 U) for different times (10, 30, 75, and
120 min) and monitoring cleavage efficiency on a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN
TGX Precast SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Having established the optimal
cleavage conditions, 2 μM of each of the proteins that only
had a TEV cleavage site was digested using 4 U TEV protease for 2
h at 25 °C, in 80 μL of 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl
and 1 mM CaCl. The proteins that also contained a Factor
Xa cleavage site were first incubated with 0.8 μg Factor Xa
protease in the aforementioned buffer for 2 h at 25 °C, followed
by the TEV protease cleavage step. Subsequently, 2 mM EDTA was added
to the cleavage mixtures. Caspase-9 activation assays were performed
by mixing 400 nM 14-3-3 protein (5× diluted from the 2 μM
protease incubation/control mixtures) with 100 nM C9-CT52, 5 μM
FC in 100 μL of 20 mM NaHPO (pH 7.0),
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg/mL BSA, at 37
°C. The mixtures were prepared in a black, flat-bottom 96-well
plate (Greiner Bio-One). After ∼20 min incubation, 200 μM
Ac-LEHD-AFC substrate (Enzo Life Sciences) was added, and the fluorescence
emission measurement was started on a Tecan Safire2 microplate reader
for 90 min with 1 min intervals. Fluorescence emission was measured
at 505 nm (5 nm bandwidth) using excitation at 400 nm (5 nm bandwidth). In the two-step assay,
first 2 μM dT1433-LEHD-BiExo* or Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold
was incubated with 5 μM FGG-C9 and 10 μM Q8 at 37 °C.
Control mixtures without FGG-C9 and/or Q8 were prepared as well. Subsequently,
at different time points these samples were diluted 5 times, and mixed
with 40 nM LgNB-CT52, 40 nM SmNB-CT32, 5 μM FC, 1 mg/mL BSA,
and 2000-fold diluted furimazine, in 20 mM NaHPO (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM TCEP. Bioluminescence
emission was measured at 11 emission wavelengths equally distributed
from 398 to 548 nm (20 nm bandwidth) on a Tecan Spark 10 M plate reader
using integration times of 100 ms. Scaffold cleavage was simultaneously
analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel analysis. In the one-pot assays, 400
nM dT1433-LEHD-BiExo* or Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo was mixed with 5
μM FGG-C9 and 10 μM Q8, in the presence of 40 nM LgNB-CT52,
40 nM SmNB-CT32, 5 μM FC, 1 mg/mL BSA, in 20 mM NaHPO (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM TCEP, at
37 °C. Control mixtures without FGG-C9 and/or Q8 were prepared
as well. At different time points, furimazine (2000-fold diluted in
final sample) was added, and bioluminescence emission was measured
at 465 ± 20 nm on a Tecan Spark 10 M plate reader using an integration
time of 100 ms. The bioluminescence emission increases over
time were fitted using  assuming first order reaction
kinetics. In ,  is the bioluminescence emission at  = 0,  the final bioluminescent
emission when a plateau has been reached and  is
the rate constant. Exo-LEHD-dT1433-LEHD-Exo scaffold,
Exo-dT1433-Exo or dT1433 (400 nM) was incubated with C9-CT52 (50,
100, or 200 nM) in the absence or presence of 10 μM FC at 18
°C in 20 mM NaHPO (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM TCEP. A control mixture without scaffold and FC
was prepared as well. Successively, at different time points fluorogenic
substrate Ac-LEHD-AFC (final concentration 200 μM) was added
and fluorescence intensity was measured on a Tecan Infinite F500 plate
reader using an exication wavelength of 400 nm (bandwidth 20 nm) and
emission wavelength of 520 nm (bandwidth 25 nm), a gain of 23 and
integration time of 40 μs. Activity (U mg) was determined from the fluorescent traces and calculated as described
before..
