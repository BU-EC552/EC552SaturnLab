An established
research practice
used in synthetic biology is the transplantation of metabolic reactions
from one species to another, with wide-ranging potential applications
including metabolic gene therapy, production
of crops without fertilizer, and more fundamental
applications in research, such as optogenetics. The exquisite temporal
and spatial precision achieved through optogenetics have been used
to develop an assortment of powerful analytical tools to control biological
functions such as gene expression, neural activity, cell signaling, secretion, peroxisomal trafficking, and protein activity. Metabolically engineering cells to endogenously produce specific
chromophores enables many optogenetic applications, including genetically
encoded systems for optical control of genes. Many of the systems used and characterized for these applications
utilize proteins that require red and far-red responsive phytobilin
chromophores like phycocyanobilin (PCB) and phytochromobilin (PΦB).
These molecules originate from phytochrome systems in cyanobacteria,
algae, and plants, but are not naturally made in many fungal species,
bacteria, or animal cells. Production of these chromophores requires biliverdin
IX-alpha (BV), a degradation product of heme, and the enzymes phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin
oxidoreductase (PcyA) or phytochromobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase
(HY2), respectively (A). Several groups produced PCB and
PΦB in  by expressing PcyA or HY2
along with heme oxygenase (HO1), without adding a ferredoxin (Fd)
and ferredoxin-NADP-reductase (FNR) reduction system from
the same species as the PcyA or HY2 enzymes. Likewise, Müller  tested PCB production
in mammalian cells by expressing cyanobacterial PcyA and HO1 in the
mitochondria but did not cointroduce a cyanobacterial Fd-FNR system. Müller  reasoned
that localizing PcyA and HO1 in the same cellular compartment where
the chromophore precursor (heme) is produced would enhance PCB production. However, in addition to heme, HO1, PcyA, and
HY2 also depend on Fd activity, leaving open the possibility that
Fd and not heme was limiting. Most cells already contain
endogenous Fd; therefore, researchers
have not typically considered it when transplanting enzymes from one
species to another. However, Beale  and Frankenberg  demonstrated that Fd activity on PcyA from  sp. PCC 7120 varies greatly depending on the species
Fd comes from. Similarly, mammalian Fds have
also been shown to be highly specific to their target enzymes, suggesting
that Fd and/or FNR may be limiting for chromophore production in mammalian
cells. Consequently, to increase production of
molecules like PCB for optogenetic uses in animal cells, we investigated
the limiting factors for the PCB and PΦB production in mammalian
cells. To evaluate the rate-limiting reactants for endogenous
chromophore
production, we systematically tested each component of the biosynthetic
pathway, including Fd and FNR. We showed that Fd+FNR is the primary
rate-limiting component, followed by heme. The increased PCB production
found with the addition of Fd+FNR was further improved by testing
different stoichiometric expression levels of each enzyme. Endogenous
PCB production was greatly increased compared to previous approaches that did not consider metabolic engineering
with Fd+FNR systems. To demonstrate the utility of increased
chromophore production
for optogenetic applications, we chose a PhyB-based optogenetic system,
which utilizes PCB and has been used to control a wide array of biological
processes. Since the light sensitivity of PhyB is proportional to
the amount of chromophore in the cell, to apply PhyB optogenetic tools
in transgenic animal models, it will be essential to genetically encode
a high level of chromophore production. Able to produce significantly
more chromophore than before, we fully
genetically encoded the red/far-red PhyB-PIF3 two-hybrid gene switch
for the first time. A genetically encoded PhyB-PIF3 system with
PCB production is particularly
significant because when bound to PhyB, chromophores such as PCB:
(i) are extremely sensitive to light (high absorbance/extinction coefficient),
(ii) have a long-lived activation state, ranging from tens of minutes
to hours, (iii) are reversible upon illumination
with a specific wavelength of far-red light, and (iv) respond to wavelengths optimal for tissue penetration.
The reversibility of this system with far-red light allows for additional
spatial control by enabling suppression of gene activity with far-red
light in specific locations. After adapting
the PhyB-PIF3 system from Shimizu Sato () for mammalian cells, we found that it can induce
gene expression by several hundred fold, it is reversible with a stable
“on state” in the order of hours, and it requires very
low amounts of red light for maximum activation (calculated to be
below the equivalent of 40 nW/cm of continuous light for
full activation over 24 h). Since genetically encoding the system
maintains a constant supply of chromophore, we were also able to find
that the light intensity required for maximal gene activation depends
on the duration of illumination. More generally than optogenetics,
there are numerous biomolecules
produced in bacteria and plants that are Fd-dependent. Matching the
Fd species to a biosynthetic production pathway makes possible the
metabolism of many other classes of molecules such as lipids, sterols,
luciferins, quinones, carotenoids, nitrates/nitrogen, and sulfites
not normally produced in those cells. Increasing production of these classes of molecules can improve
agriculture, increase the production of pharmaceuticals, and enable
other tools for synthetic biology. PCB and PφB production is limited by Fd+FNR
in mammalian
cells. (A) The metabolic pathway forPCB synthesis including the NADPH/FNR/Fd

production using the plasmids shown. Phytobilin production was measured

production can be limited by heme, Fd or FNR, we tested limiting factors of PCB production in mammalian cells
using combinations of these components in excess. Zinc-PAGE PhyB immunoprecipitation
assays in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells were used to test
PCB production with metabolic enzymes from two species:  (SYNP2/sPcyA) or  (THEEB/tPcyA). We tested PCB production under two
conditions, either mitochondrial-HO1+PcyA () or mitochondrial-HO1+PcyA+Fd+FNR
(), (B). When either species of HO1+PcyA enzymes were expressed,
we detected low levels of PCB (B, ). However, when all four enzymes
HO1+PcyA+Fd+FNR () were expressed, we observed a striking
increase in PCB levels (B), which agrees with recent findings from Uda () To exclude the possibility
that this was specific to cyanobacterial enzymes, we also produced
the plant chromophore PΦB, by replacing the cyanobacterial PcyA
with a plant homologue  HY2. PcyA and
HY2 showed the same Fd+FNR dependence (B, ). It is noteworthy that the Fd+FNR-dependent
increase in PΦB production was still observed when plant HY2
was used along with cyanobacterial HO1/Fd/FNR. We chose SYNP2 Fd+FNR
for recycling HY2 because SYNP2 Fd was more similar than THEEB Fd
in amino acid sequence identity to  Fds
and specifically the major ferredoxin that recycles HY2 in  (). However, PΦB production may be further
increased by employing  Fd+FNR enzymes.
It may be possible to predict compatibility of a transplanted ferredoxin-dependent
pathway to the host cells Fd based on sequence similarity as shown
in . These findings show that excess
Fd+FNR activity can increase PCB or PΦB production in mammalian
cells (B). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00413/suppl_file/sb7b00413_si_001.pdf Next, we delineated the limiting factors for the endogenous production
of chromophores in mammalian cells. We decided to test PCB production
in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria because the endogenous ferredoxin
system of mammalian cells is localized in the mitochondria; therefore,
we considered the cytoplasmic enzyme localization as a condition with
negligible endogenous Fd+FNR activity. We show in A that expression of cytoplasmic-PcyA+HO1
() is not sufficient to produce significant levels
of PCB (lane 3  lane 2). When cytoplasmic-PcyA+HO1
was cotransfected along with cytoplasmic Fd+FNR ()
higher, but statistically nonsignificant levels of PCB were detected
(lane 3  4,  > 0.05). Similarly,
when PcyA+HO1 were localized to the mitochondria (),
very low levels of PCB were detected (lane 5). However, when PcyA+HO1
and Fd+FNR were all localized to the mitochondria (), PCB production was significantly increased when compared to PcyA+HO1
only () (lane 5  6,  < 0.001). These findings were corroborated by imaging PhyB-bound
PCB using the Cy-5 channel (blue) (). These results demonstrate that the Fd+FNR system is the primary
limiting factor of the PCB production pathway in mammalian mitochondria,
but it is not sufficient for high levels of PCB production when expressed
in the cytoplasm. Since heme is a metabolic precursor in the PCB
production pathway,
we systematically tested if it was limiting for PCB production in
either the cytoplasm or in the mitochondria. We hypothesized that
if heme was a limiting factor for PCB production in the cytoplasm,
then the addition of excess heme would increase production. While
a faint band was visible in +heme (A lane 9), it was indistinguishable
from cells transfected with PhyB and no enzymes and given excess heme
(A lane 8).
However, excess heme significantly increased levels of PCB production
in the  condition (lanes 4 and 10,  < 0.01). In addition, we found that Fd+FNR was limiting when
comparing +heme to +heme (lanes 9 and
10,  < 0.01). This demonstrates that heme is
the limiting factor for PCB production when an excess of Fd+FNR is
present in the cytoplasm. Importantly, PCB production was not influenced
by excess heme when enzymes were localized to the mitochondria (–heme and +heme, lanes 6 and 12).
This confirms that Fd+FNR is primarily limiting in both the cytoplasm
and the mitochondria and that heme is secondarily limiting only in
the cytoplasm. To further investigate the PCB production dependence
on Fd, we
transfected cells with two, three or all four enzymes in the pathway:
PcyA-HO1 (), PcyA+HO1+Fd (), or PcyA+HO1+Fd+FNR
(), along with PhyB for all conditions (B). We show in B that the addition of Fd to
PcyA+HO1 () significantly increased PCB production
compared to PcyA+HO1 alone () ( <
0.05). Importantly, Fd+FNR () produces significantly
more PCB than adding Fd alone ( < 0.01), demonstrating
that for maximum PCB production both Fd and FNR are required. While we considered testing the overexpression of the host cell’s
Fd+FNR, there are noteworthy advantages to using orthogonal Fd+FNR
matching the species of the transplanted metabolic pathway. The mammalian
Fd+FNR may be able to reduce BV bound to PcyA but only at a fraction
of the rate of the cyanobacterial Fd+FNR. The required overexpression
needed for the host cell’s system to perform at the same production
rate would therefore more likely disturb the cell’s metabolism.
Using an orthogonal system would be more efficient and would also
less likely interact with the host cell’s metabolic proteins.
Matching the orthogonal enzyme species thus allows for minimal perturbation
of the normal host cell physiology and at the same time maximize production
rates. Order of rate limiting factors of PCB production in mammalian
cells.
(A,B) HEK293 cells were analyzed for PCB production using the plasmids

Therefore, we hypothesized that PCB production may be further optimized
through enzyme stoichiometry. We transfected separate PcyA+HO1 and
Fd+FNR plasmids at different ratios and observed that PCB production
was highly dependent on the ratio between PcyA+HO1 and Fd+FNR (A). Considering this,
to serve as a quantitative guide for optimizing PCB production, we
developed computational models of this pathway using coupled ordinary
differential equations (model details in ). We tested the enzyme stoichiometry using a functional
PhyB-PIF3 luciferase gene expression system adapted from Shimizu Sato () (B). First, we used optimized versions of
the PhyB-PIF3 switch, including optimizing DNA binding domains (), activation domains (), and reporter constructs (). Next, the stoichiometry was tested by transfecting different
ratios of the PcyA+HO1 and Fd+FNR plasmids and illuminating the cells
with red light for 24 h (timeline of illumination as shown in ), followed by a luciferase assay to
compare gene induction levels. We found that gene activation levels
were also highly dependent on enzyme stoichiometry, with only the
17:1 PcyA+HO1:Fd+FNR showing any measurable response to light (C and D,  < 0.01). This demonstrates how chromophore
levels influence the performance of PhyB optogenetic systems. Stoichiometry

Schematic of the PhyB-PIF3 light switch. PhyB is fused to a DNA Binding
Domain (DBD) and bound to a light-sensitive chromophore (PCB). The
PhyB-DBD fusion remains bound to the UAS promoter. PIF3 is fused to
an Activation Domain (AD). Upon absorption of a red photon (660 nm),
PhyB changes conformation and recruits PIF3 to the promoter region.
The AD fused to PIF3 then activates the gene downstream of the promoter.
Upon absorption of a far-red photon (735 nm), PhyB changes conformation
that leads to PIF3 unbinding, removing the AD from the promoter, shutting
the downstream gene off. (C) Plasmid maps for endogenous PCB production

PCB production, we sought to encode all four biosynthetic enzymes
on a single plasmid. Our original four enzyme plasmid (pPKm-245) contained
all PCB biosynthetic enzymes separated by P2A sequences to achieve
a 1:1:1:1 expression level of each enzyme. However, the results in A–D suggested that PCB production could be further
optimized by modifying the plasmid’s expression stoichiometry.
To this end, we replaced one of the P2A sequences with an Internal
Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES), which typically gives 1 order of magnitude
lower expression to the gene following the IRES sequence. The plasmid pPKm-244 was generated by placing an IRES between  and , leading to higher PcyA-HO1
levels and lower Fd+FNR levels (E). We also constructed a plasmid, pPKm-248, containing , , and  all placed
after the IRES sequence. This plasmid results in minimized heme oxygenase
and Fd+FNR activity while keeping higher levels of PcyA (E). Using the experiment
timeline in , we found that lowering
HO1 and Fd+FNR levels with the pPKm-248 plasmid produced 1.8-fold
( < 0.05) and 2.2-fold ( <
0.01) higher gene activation levels than pPKm-244 and pPKm-245 respectively
(F). In addition
to producing more PCB, lower expression of HO1, Fd and FNR should
provide maximal PCB levels with minimal interference in the host cells
metabolism. Light Sensitivity of the Mammalian PhyB-PIF3
Gene Switch Using
Endogenously Produced PCB PhyB-PIF optogenetic systems in
animal cells have mostly been characterized in conditions where PCB
is added externally. However, PCB degrades rapidly in cell culture
media, which affects PhyB’s light
sensitivity over long time spans. Since
our constructs enable constant endogenous production of PCB, we sought
to test the light sensitivity of the PhyB-PIF3 switch (pPKm-230) with
the endogenously produced chromophore. We illuminated transfected
cells with the activating red light, at different intensities for
24 h, and found that light intensities of 1.00 μmol/m/s, 0.1 μmol/m/s, and 0.01 μmol/m/s achieved similar high levels of gene activation (B and D). In contrast, transfected cells illuminated with a light intensity
of 0.001 μmol/m/s had a significantly lower gene
response ( < 0.05). Since the system is bistable, we reasoned that activating with intensities
between 1.0 and 0.01 μmol/m/s, which activate the
system over a long time span (24 h), may not represent saturating
amounts of light for shorter illumination times. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the gene switch
using these same light intensities, but with a single 1 min pulse
of red light (C and E). Unlike the 24-h illumination experiment,
we found that when we illuminated the cells with red light for 1 min,
light intensities of 0.1 μmol/m/s and 0.01 μmol/m/s had a significantly lower gene response than an intensity
of 1.0 μmol/m/s ( < 0.001).
This finding highlight that for characterizing these light responsive
bistable proteins, we should consider both the light intensity and
duration of illumination. For example, our results using 0.1 μmol/m/s and 0.01 μmol/m/s show that those intensities
are not saturating with a 1 min pulse, but those same intensities
induce saturating activation levels over 24 h (D and E). This is
expected from a system that is bistable with a long-lived activation
state, inactive molecules not activated
in the first minute will be activated later if light is continuously
applied, eventually activating all of the light-sensitive molecules. Light

Gene Switch Bistability and Reversibility
with Far-Red Light We further tested the light sensitivity
and bistability by shining activating red light at different pulse
intervals (F). As controls, we illuminated HEK293 cells with continuous 1.0
μmol/m/s or 0.1 μmol/m/s red light
for 24 h and found they reach similar levels of gene activation. In
addition to continuous illumination, we utilized alternating light/dark
cycles composed of 1 min of red light and 4, 9, or 29 min of darkness
(1 min/4 min, 1 min/9 min, 1 min/29 min respectively) for 24 h. Continuous
red light at 0.1 μmol/m/s, as well as the 1 min/4
min and 1 min/9 min conditions, did not produce statistically different
activation levels (F). In contrast, the condition with 0.1 μmol/m/s of red light pulsed at 1 min/29 min had significantly lower activation
levels than continuous light and pulsed light in the 1 min/4 min and
1 min/9 min conditions (F,  < 0.05). Because the 1 min/9 min
(blue star) condition has one-tenth the number of photons as 0.1 μmol/m/s in total photon flux, it is equivalent in the number of
photons to 0.01 μmol/m/s of continuous illumination
or 183 nW/cm for 660 nm red light. This agrees with the
result where the same total amount of light is applied continuously,
suggesting that the activation state of PhyB is much longer than the
9 min dark interval (D and F). Interestingly, we
also found that cells containing the PhyB-PIF3 system had a slightly
higher level of gene activation in the darkness than cells in the
presence of far-red light, potentially due to the bistability of the
protein (F).
Thermodynamically, in darkness, a mixed population of species (Pf
and Pfr forms) is the expected nature of a bistable molecule, since
some PhyB molecules can spontaneously switch to the “activated
state”. Therefore, the proportion of activated PhyB molecules
should be higher in darkness than when PhyB is illuminated with a
deactivating far-red light. Since pulsing the light on a minute
time scale achieved similar
levels of activation as continuous light (F), we decided to test the duration of the
activated state of PCB bound PhyB (PhyB·PCB) by increasing the
spacing between red light pulses as shown in G. Our results show similar levels of gene
activation for red light pulses delivered for 1 min every 8, 6, 4,
2, 1 h, and a half hour at 1 μmol/m/s (H). However, a pulse
delivered every 12 h (a total of two pulses in the 24 h period) produced
significantly lower gene activation than the pulses delivered in the
shorter intervals (H). It is possible that those two pulses in the 24-h period
delivered too little total amount of light to fully activate the system
(I). However,
this data still supports that the switch effectively stays “on”
for at least 8 h following a 1 min pulse of 1 μmol/m/s of red light (H, blue arrow). In terms of total light delivery (μmol/m), the 1 min pulses every 8 h using 1.0 μmol/m/s is effectively equivalent to the number of photons with continuous
light at 0.0021 μmol/m/s or 38nW/cm for
660 nm light, which is a strikingly small amount of light and speaks
to the high sensitivity of this system. One hallmark of PhyB
based optogenetic switches is their conformational
reversibility upon absorption of another photon of a different wavelength. While the ability for PCB bound PhyB (PhyB·PCB)
to isomerize upon red light absorption and reverse upon far-red light
absorption has been previously shown, whether
the PhyB(1–621)-DBD and PIF3(1–524)-AD interaction was
reversible by far-red light when expressed in mammalian cells has
not been tested. To test the reversibility of
the switch, we exposed HEK293 cells, transfected with the PhyB-PIF3
switch and endogenously producing PCB constructs (A), to either 24 h of red light,
12 h of red light followed by 12 h of darkness, or 12 h of red light
followed by 12 h of far-red light (B). Luciferase expression was significantly
lower in cells shifted into darkness after 12 h of continuous red
light than cells exposed to 24 h of light ( <
0.05), indicating PhyB reversed to its inactive state once red-light
illumination ended. Compared to switching from red light to darkness,
switching from red to far-red light showed significantly lower luciferase
expression, indicating that the far-red light inactivated the gene
switch (red box,  < 0.05). This result indicates
that after red light activation, the switch remains on for some time
in the darkness and that it can be switched off with far-red light.
This finding has important implications for the switch’s ability
to control genes since it shows that the gene expression levels can
be titrated temporally by timing the duration of red light or by red
light followed by far-red light. Thus, this system can be used for
spatial control by patterning red and far-red light for targeted localization
of gene activation. PhyB-PIF3 light switch

Gene Switch in Several Mammalian
Cell Lines http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00413/suppl_file/sb7b00413_si_001.pdf We also tested the PhyB-PIF3 gene switch performance
in different cell types containing endogenously produced PCB. We transfected
HEK293, hepatocellular carcinoma (HUH-7), HeLa, and mouse fibroblasts
(3T3) cells with the PhyB-PIF3 gene switch and HO1+PcyA+Fd+FNR plasmids
(pPKm-230 and pPKm-248, respectively). We used 1 μmol/m/s of red light illumination in a cycle composed of 1 min
pulses of red light followed by 4 min of darkness, for a duration
of 24 h (C).
The PhyB-PIF3 switch with endogenously produced PCB activated luciferase
about 280-fold in HEK293 cells, 70-fold in HUH-7 cells, 300-fold in
HeLa cells and 440-fold in 3T3 cells. These findings show that the
system is effective in producing PCB and activating different mammalian
cell types. While we have highly optimized the PhyB-PIF3 light switch
with endogenously produced PCB, there are several ways to customize
the levels of activation or leakiness to tailor it to specific cell
types and applications. For example, different activation or repression
domains could be used (). In addition,
there are still other permutations of gene fusions that can be tested
in future studies that may further enhance this system, such as using
a DBD on the N-terminus of PhyB or optimizing linker sequences. Using
a stronger or tissue-specific promoter to drive expression of PCB
or PΦB biosynthetic enzymes may also lead to higher activation
levels or can restrict light sensitivity to specific cell types. As presented in this research, using wavelengths
that are optimal for tissue penetration, the PhyB(1–621)-PIF3 gene switch with endogenously produced
PCB is among the most light-sensitive optogenetic switches. We have shown that the Fd+FNR system is the rate-limiting factor
for the production of the chromophores PCB and PΦB in the mitochondria
of mammalian cells, and is limited by the Fd+FNR system followed by
heme in the cytoplasm. The ability to produce PCB and PΦB with
PcyA and HY2, respectively, suggests that matching reduction systems
that efficiently supply electrons to a metabolic pathway can also
enhance the production of other bilins and other classes of molecules.
This finding creates new opportunities for engineering synthetic systems
to produce these chromophores, along with many other molecules. This
has potential industrial applications in decreasing costs of crop
production, producing plant molecules in microbes, or delivering therapeutic
molecules  genetically encoded pathways. Genetically encoding endogenous production of chromophores like
PCB also enables the use of several existing and compatible optogenetic
tools to regulate cell signaling, cell migration, or protein localization without the addition of exogenous chemicals. This makes possible
the use of PhyB when constant levels of PCB are required, facilitating
potential  applications, or when the addition
of PCB to samples is not practical (such as when samples are in a
sealed container or for long illumination times). This study achieves
the long-sought goals in optogenetics of enabling high-level production
of the chromophores PCB and PΦB in mammalian cells and demonstrates
a more general method for efficiently producing molecules from one
species in another. Zinc-PAGE-Immunoprecipitation
Assays Protein G PLUS-Agarose
(ThermoFisher, 22851) beads were prepared by adding 200 μg anti-HA
(clone HA-7, Sigma H9658) into 2 mL 25% agarose. After overnight binding
at 4 °C, unbound anti-HA was washed off four times with 1×
Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS, pH 7.4, ThermoFisher, 10010023). For
each 6-well plate, 500 000 HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) were
transfected using 2.5 μg DNA and 6 μL of Lipofectamine
2000 per well (ThermoFisher Scientific, 11668019). For heme experiments,
media or media containing 10 μM heme (Frontier Scientific, H651–9),
was exchanged 18 h after transfection and again 43 h after transfection.
Heme was dissolved at 10 mM in 100 mM NaOH and sterile filtered with
a 0.22 μM filter (Millipore, SLGP033RS). Cells were then harvested
with RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 25 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.10% SDS and 2.5 mM EDTA, and 2× protease
inhibitors (Sigma, P8340–1 ML)), immediately placed on ice,
sonicated briefly and then centrifuged for 30 min at 21 000. BCA assays (ThermoFisher Scientific, 23225) were used
to determine the protein concentration of resulting supernatant/lysates.
Equal masses for each protein sample were diluted with two parts of
cold PBS, then loaded onto Protein G PLUS-Agarose beads containing
anti-HA (preparation above), for overnight binding while mixing at
4 °C. Next beads were washed and boiled in sample buffer (30%
glycerol, 10% SDS, 300 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.03% Bromophenol Blue, 179
mM 2-Mercaptoethanol). After loading and running the samples in a
SDS-PAGE gel, the gels were incubated in SDS-PAGE Running Buffer (25
mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS) containing 10 mM Zinc Acetate for
10 min prior to imaging in a Fluorochem E (Protein Simple). Gels were
then transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with the primary antibody
anti-HA 1:5000 (Sigma, clone HA-7, H9658), and by Goat anti-Mouse
secondary antibody 1:5000 (ThermoFisher, 32230). Western blots were
imaged in a Fluorochem E (Protein Simple). Gel bands were quantified
using the FIJI (ImageJ) gel analysis tool. HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573),
plated at 100 000 cells per well in a 24-well plate, were transfected
24 h after plating on polylysine (Sigma P6407–5 mg) coated
coverslips in each well. 43 h later, the media was exchanged with
fresh media or media+5 μM PCB (Frontier Scientific, P14137)
for the NE+PCB control. One hour later, cells were rinsed in 1×
PBS and then fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 10 min.
Cells were then washed with 1× PBS before incubating in permeabilization
buffer (5% BSA + 0.3% TritonX-100 in PBS) for 30 min, followed by
incubating with primary antibodies, anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal 1:1000
(Sigma, F3165) and polyclonal anti-HA rabbit 1:500 (Santa Cruz, Y-11)
in antibody buffer (2% BSA + 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS) at 4 °C
overnight. Next coverslips were rinsed twice and washed three times
in 1× PBS and then incubated in antibody buffer containing goat
anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 1:1000 (ThermoFisher, A11001), and goat
anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 568 1:1000 (ThermoFisher, A11011). Coverslips
were rinsed and washed again, then mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech,
0100–20). Images were taken using a DeltaVision RT Deconvolution
Microscope. Cell Culture, Transfection, Light Induction

were cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM,
Gibco, 11965–092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Omega Scientific, FB-02) and 100 U/mL of penicillin and 0.1
mg/mL of streptomycin (Gibco, 11548876). All cells were cultured under
5% CO at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at 100 000
HEK293 cells per well in 24-well plates, 24 h before transfection.
Transfection of plasmids was achieved through lipofection following
the manufacturer’s instructions and protocol (Lipofectamine
2000, ThermoFisher, 11668019). For each transfection reaction, a total
of 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA was combined with specific plasmid
ratios for each experiment as detailed in . A construct with Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid DNA
was included as an internal transfection control in all transfections.
The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium 24 h after transfection
and the plates were placed inside black boxes (Hammond Manufacturing
Company, 1591ESBK) for the remainder of the experimental procedure.
For conditions where external PCB is added, 15 μM of PCB (Frontier
Scientific, P14137) from a 20 mM stock dissolved in DMSO (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-202581) was supplemented in fresh medium 24 h after
transfection (). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00413/suppl_file/sb7b00413_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00413/suppl_file/sb7b00413_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00413/suppl_file/sb7b00413_si_001.pdf Light
induction was programmed to start 12 h after medium replacement. Each
black box was equipped with a circuit consisting of six red LEDs (660
nm, Thorlabs, M660L3), except for the dark boxes and far-red boxes
which had no LEDs or a single far-red LED (735 nm, Thorlabs, M735L2),
respectively. In addition, each black box circuit was designed to
allow for fine adjustment of light intensity (circuitry is shown ), from 0.0008 to 200 μmol/m/s. Light intensity was measured in μW at the cell level,
converted to μmol/m/s (light sensor area = 63.6
mm), and adjusted for each experiment design using Sper
Scientific Direct’s Laser Power Meter (SSD, 8400). Detailed
information on wavelengths, illumination intensity, and duration used
for each experimental procedure and data shown are detailed in . Pulse duration and total illumination
times were electronically controlled  a LabVIEW
computer driving an Arduino microprocessor and custom-made circuits
(see ). Luciferase assays were carried
out using the Dual-Luciferase Assay system (Promega, PRE1960), and
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were lysed immediately
after removing from the incubator using the manufacturer’s
instructions. Firefly and Renilla Luciferase activities were measured
from cell lysates using the luminometer module of the Infinite 200
PRO multimode reader (Tecan). Results of luciferase activity assays
are expressed as a ratio of firefly luciferase (Fluc) activity to
Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity. Illumination Circuits and

an  model to describe the
biochemical interactions among the enzymes that compose the hypothesized
PCB-production pathway, as seen in A. The quantitative mathematical model was
parametrized () by experimental
data and uses ordinary differential equations to describe the changes
in the concentration of the molecular components of the reaction.
We probed the proposed model directly as proposed in the literature
and similar pathways published. We complement this work showing the model’s agreement with
the tested pathway, demonstrating how heme, Fd, and FNR are rate limiting
factors for the production of PCB, as confirmed experimentally in ,  and . A full description of the kinetic
model can be found in . Marvin was used for drawing and displaying chemical
