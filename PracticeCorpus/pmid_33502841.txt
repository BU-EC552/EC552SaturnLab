Directed evolution has emerged
as a powerful approach to protein engineering that complements rational
design. One key to success in the random combinatorial exploration
of protein sequence diversity is the ability to screen large numbers
of library members, at low cost and preferably automatically at ultrahigh
throughput. Sequence space is vast and only sparsely populated with
“islands” of desired function and reaching them relies
on chance. selections
(e.g., for survival) provide ready access to the testing of large
libraries but may be compromised by incompatibility with the host
organism and encumbered by possible diversity loss of libraries due
to low transformation efficiency.  systems
are required to improve the intrinsic properties of a protein by overcoming
such constraints in order to explore larger fractions of sequence
space bias-free without host interference. Compartmentalization of
genes into water-in-oil emulsion droplets, akin to artificial single
purpose cell-like structures, provides a completely artificial format
for combining genotype and phenotype. Highly
monodisperse droplets can be generated and analyzed in an automated
and highly controlled way in microfluidic devices and allow a massive
scale-down to picoliter volumes along with a massive scale-up of screening
throughput to >10 candidates per day. However, a demonstration of its
utility in an actual library selection in this quantitative  format is still lacking. Here we address
the conspicuous absence of a complete  directed evolution campaign in monodisperse microfluidic
droplets. Early  compartmentalization directed
evolution campaigns in polydisperse droplets had been successful, but often relied on modification of the coding
DNA (or conjugates) as the readout of activity and were limited to
improvement of already rather active enzymes. Systems for microfluidic
droplet evolution on chip using  expression
systems have been developed, but only enrichment experiments have
been documented. Enrichment experiments are often
used to validate a workflow, but do not require the selection and
recovery of single catalyst genes (in a sea of genes that are not
selected), that is, circumstances typical for the low hit rates in
a library experiment. Also, enrichment experiments using an  workflow, in which each droplet is filled with
multiple copies of a gene at the outset circumvent key challenges of a complete directed evolution that
starts with Poisson-distribution of single gene copies of library
members. Such a true library evolution experiment in droplets has
indeed not been reported thus far. However,  expression is possible from single genes, and DNA amplification by PCR or by isothermal
amplification increases the number of
expression templates, leading to more enzyme molecules and a more
detectable product. Amplification will also make it easier to recover
selected hits. Coordinating DNA amplification,  expression, and enzymatic reaction is tricky, because of droplet
stability and device complexity in a PCR-based protocol that requires
heating/cooling steps in thermocycling, or—in the case of isothermal
amplification—because of potential cross-inhibition among more
than 70 components, that are present at once in droplet compartments
after all addition steps (shown in ). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf In this work we demonstrate how controlled, stepwise on-chip
addition
of the components for these three processes leads to a robust workflow
that remedies the current impasse in  evolution
in microfluidic droplets. We set out to evolve Savinase, a subtilisin-like
protease naturally secreted by the alkalophilic bacterium  for nutrition and defense and commercially developed for the detergent industry. Its multiple uses in fine chemical synthesis, washing powder, and
other biotechnological applications explain why it is produced on
a multiton-scale. This enzyme class is covered by numerous patents,
yet no directed evolution has been reported. The expression of Savinase
in  is not possible due to its acute cytotoxicity.
The possible alternative of using  as
a directed evolution host would limit the library size due to its
poor transformation efficiency (of typically only hundreds) compared to the throughput of millions in droplet
microfluidics. Therefore, cell-free protein synthesis is necessary
to evolve this enzyme. We designed an ultrahigh-throughput screening
platform for  directed evolution of Savinase
that is illustrated in . In a first step single genes (as plasmids or circularized
genes containing a T7 promotor as well as a ribosome-binding site)
were encapsulated on-chip into monodisperse droplets (∼14 pL).
Starting with these “monoclonal” droplets, single gene
copies were amplified by rolling circle amplification (RCA). RCA uses
random hexamer primers and can potentially amplify any DNA in a nonspecific
manner. This isothermal process is easier
to handle in a device compared to PCR that requires heating modules and avoids droplet coalescence at elevated temperatures.
While higher Φ29 DNA polymerase concentrations are attractive
(., 0.07 pg/μL DNA leads to up to 30 000
copies per gene), strong inhibition of
subsequent  expression was observed at the
highest possible Φ29 concentration (500 nM), along with droplet
destabilization (see , ). A productive balance between
optimal DNA amplification and droplet stability was obtained by using
a Φ29 DNA polymerase concentration of 100 nM and performing
RCA for 6 h at 30 °C. Given RCA inhibition by the reagents used
for  transcription and translation (IVTT)
() and the requirement of different
incubation temperatures for optimal performance of  processes, these steps were performed separately. To achieve the
separation of RCA and IVTT in one microfluidic device, a design that
first injected IVTT components (PURE) into droplets was used. Defined volumes (equal to the volume of
the droplet; varying between experiments but typically in the range
of ∼10–15 pL) were introduced into surfactant-stabilized
droplets at rates of 1 kHz using an electro-microfluidic picoinjector. After the addition of IVTT, the droplets were
incubated off-chip for another 4 h at 37 °C. To start the reaction
under controlled conditions (i.e., after completion of amplification
and expression) and in a pH range that is not necessarily compatible
with the preparatory steps, the fluorogenic substrate (a BODIPY-labeled
casein that generates fluorescence after cleavage) was picoinjected
(∼20–30 pL at 0.5 kHz). A 2-fold higher green fluorescent
signal (compared to the simultaneous injection of IVTT mixture and
casein substrate) was obtained by adding the substrate after enzyme
production (). After addition
of the substrate, the droplets were incubated off-chip to allow for
hydrolytic cleavage. Starting with single genes in monoclonal and
monodisperse droplets, followed by the addition of identical volumes
of IVTT and substrate, the equal expression and assay conditions in
each droplet suggest a level playing field for subsequent screening.
At the completion of an incubation period of 3 days, droplets were
reinjected into a sorting device and the brightest ones were selectively
extracted by fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) to select active proteases. A control experiment
demonstrates that the complex workflow was absolutely necessary to
create a viable assay: adding all reagents at once into droplets in
a standard flow focusing device design produced no
measurable product (),
suggesting that fine-tuning of the concentration, conditions, and
order of addition was crucial to overcome the incompatibility of different
reagents and bring about the reaction product of Savinase at detectable
levels. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf The workflow was validated by a sorting experiment to
enrich droplets
expressing Savinase wildtype (sav-wt) from an excess of droplets producing
the esterase EstB, which is an enzyme that is not active on the fluorogenic
casein substrate. Both DNA constructs were mixed in a 1:250 ratio
and the abundance of sav-wt before and after sorting was analyzed
via quantitative PCR (qPCR). The initial content of 0.4% sav-wt plasmid
was increased to 99% sav-wt plasmids after sorting, giving an enrichment
of 250-fold (calculated according to Zinchenko et al.) or 300 000-fold (calculated according to Baret
et al.,, ). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf Next, six
Savinase libraries were designed by targeting six active
site loops that play a role in substrate binding and mutating 9–11 residues located around the active
site (A and ). Randomization was achieved using
a Slonomics approach, resulting in approximately
three mutations per gene () and
library sizes of up to 10 variants. These six Savinase
libraries were interrogated (C,E and ): 500 000
to 4 000 000 droplets were screened to yield 34 to 200
hits per library (). For lib-1
0.02% of the droplets were selected and for lib-6 0.004% of the population,
respectively. This value depends on the presence of highly active
variants within the library screened and the detection threshold set
up at the beginning of the selection. In general, the sorting gate
was set up, so that droplets showing increased fluorescence over the
population average were selected. The selected droplets were subsequently
de-emulsified and DNA (i.e., of long concatemers resulting from RCA)
was recovered. For low-throughput rescreening, these hits were expressed
in the original producer, . After PCR
amplification of the recovered hit DNA and cloning into the expression
and secretion vector pCri18a,  was transformed.
Resulting transformants were screened in 96-well plates for hydrolysis
of the fluorogenic casein substrate that has been used for the screening
in droplets. Rescreening 88 randomly picked colonies of the six Savinase
libraries before and after sorting shows an enrichment of variants
with higher activity than sav-wt from 1% to 53% for lib-1 and 8% to
56% for lib-6 (D,F and ). Sequencing of the
hits from each library identified during the rescreening revealed
58 unique sequences in total. These Savinase variants were recombinantly
produced in , purified and further tested
against the fluorogenic casein substrate (). From six libraries, 16 variants were found to be the
most active ones, exhibiting up to 3-fold improvements on their initial
rates  (). The different mutations observed are shown in Supporting Information, . Overall, two to four mutations per
gene were found (matching the expected mutation rates; ). In 10 out of the 16 variants selected,
residues were found to be mutated to arginine or lysine. These two
positively charged basic amino acids are mostly exposed to the protein
surface and play important roles in protein stability by forming electrostatic
interactions. The pI of the substrate
casein has been determined to be 4.6, so that its surface at pH values
around 8 is negatively charged. Savinase with a pI of 10 has a positive
surface charge at this pH, so replacement of negatively charged or
neutral residues by positively charged basic amino acids arginine
and lysine slightly enhances this charge, potentially promoting enzyme–substrate
interaction driven by electrostatic attraction. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf To accumulate beneficial mutations
identified during the screening
campaign and select for synergistic effects, a shuffled library was
generated via staggered extension process (StEP). The shuffled library was screened on our new ultrahigh-throughput
droplet screening platform (A). The platform shows that 0.09% of the population
passed the selection threshold and were selected, resulting in 100
hits (). Rescreening in microtiter
plates and sequencing identified five shuffled variants with up to
5.5-fold increased activity compared to the wildtype (B,C and ). Previous directed evolution campaigns
and engineering of subtilisin-like proteases had only achieved improvements in biophysical properties, namely,
temperature stability, cold-adaptation, tolerance to cosolvent, or specificity
changes at the expense of activity. In conclusion, a cell-free ultrahigh-throughput screening platform
for the directed evolution of subtilisin Savinase in droplets has
been established. Stepwise DNA amplification, IVTT, and substrate
conversion in droplets have provided the basis for  evolution in droplets, overcoming the previous inability to carry
out  evolution campaigns in this format,
by removing cross-inhibition effects of reagents and careful choice
of reaction conditions. The  of multiple
steps into a robust workflow with automated processing and screening
of “monoclonal” droplets (each representing one library
member) and the efficient recovery of hits has been key to the success
of this approach. A cytotoxic protease that could not be evolved in  or yeast was substantially improved in two rounds
of screening, with a large number of >50 hits recovered to allow
further
improvement by reshuffling. Using  as an alternative host for secretion
of proteases (e.g., in microtiter plates) would be limited by the
poor transformation efficiency of this host: merely a few hundred
transformants per μg DNA are possible, effectively reducing library size. By contrast, the complete absence
of a transformation barrier when working in droplets makes multiple
rounds of mutation/recombination and screening with larger libraries
possible.  droplet screening may also prove
advantageous for functional screening of environmental libraries.
Previous discovery campaigns of metagenomic proteases were based on agar plate screenings. Using our cell-free workflow
the throughput would be improved 100-fold and the absence of potential
incompatibility with host organisms should lead to more hits. Practically this strategy is highly economical: Compared to screening
in microtiter plates RCA and IVTT reagents are 150 000-fold
reduced, allowing the screening of 10 genes using only
140 μL of RCA mix and IVTT components. This approach will help
to put currently impossible experiments in directed evolution and
metagenomic screening into reality, enlarging the list of practically
discoverable or evolvable candidates to other cytotoxic or membrane
proteins. Based on the degrees of freedom enabled by this approach
non-natural reaction conditions (including the introduction of non-natural
amino acids or cofactors) can be explored and freely chosen selection
pressures can be applied in droplet screening. Functional screening for protease activity using
microfluidic droplets.
Single plasmids of a randomized Savinase library (1) were compartmentalized
in picoliter water-in-oil droplets (2) together with reagents to perform
rolling circle amplification (RCA, 3). After an off-chip incubation
of emulsion droplets, reagents for  transcription
and translation were added stepwise (4). Droplets were incubated off
chip for another 4 h at 37 °C before the fluorogenic casein substrate
was picoinjected (5). Emulsion droplets were then reinjected into
a sorting device and strongly fluorescent droplets were collected
(6). Selected droplets were de-emulsified and RCA product was recovered
followed by restriction and ligation (7). Plasmids containing DNA
sequences of active catalysts were transformed into , rescreened, and sequenced (8) to identify improved catalysts. For
further enrichment, iterative selections led to improved enzyme variants.
The three key steps that had to be separated in this work to achieve
successful selection of proteases with increased activity (overcoming
previous limitations) are highlighted by the central box. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00538/suppl_file/sb0c00538_si_001.pdf Generation of six different
